S'<p>In determining the valid grounds of immediate termination of a Managing \r\nDirector, the knowledge available to the parties in regards to the \r\nreasons for making the termination effective are decisive.</p><p>GRP Rainer Attorneys and Tax Advisors in Cologne, Berlin, Bonn, Bremen, Duesseldorf, Essen, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich, Nuremberg, Stuttgart and London www.grprainer.com/en explain: With its judgment dated April 9, 2013 (file ref. no.: II ZR 273/11), the German Federal Supreme Court (BGH) took a formal position as to the circumstances of a termination without notice of a GmbH Managing Director. The immediate termination of a Managing Director is governed by the German Civil Code (BGB). For such termination, it is required that termination is effective within two weeks after receiving knowledge of the determining factors of the termination. In the aforementioned judgment, the BGH decided that the determination of the grounds for termination depends on the known reasons giving cause to the decision for immediate termination which were known by the decision-making party. In the case of a GmbH, such a party would be the general meeting of shareholders or the sole shareholder. Deviating from that, however, shareholders are free to transfer authority to issue effective terminations to other persons. This can be done, for example, by a provision in the articles of association.<br /><br />For them, the knowledge of the determining factors of termination which enacted the two-week period should then be presented once the party (or parties) has collected all relevant information which would be necessary for making a decision in regards to a possible termination.<br /><br />In particular, the plaintiff asserted in the present case that the termination was not effective as it was not enacted within the above-mentioned, two-week period. The BGH did not agree with this notion. The Court cited the justification that having to know or grossly negligent ignorance does not influence the start of the two-week period. For the start of the two-week period, only the actual knowledge itself is decisive.<br /><br />The substance of company law is often difficult to penetrate and quite complex even for Managing Directors and shareholders. Questions pertaining to the liability of persons involved in the event of terminations pose challenges and to those affected.<br /><br />An attorney can clarify the facts of any given case and determine possible claims. Oftentimes, immediate action is required to enforce claims.

aS'<p>-Blog posted but not reviewed or edited by LedgerLaw-</p><p>An attorney plays a significant role in the litigation of accident cases. Hiring an inexperienced or unskillful attorney can affect the chances of an accident case in court. This is why the topic of hiring accident attorneys shouldn&#8217;t be treated lightly. On the other hand, experienced and skilful accident attorneys ensure that their clients are well represented and also obtain the maximum level of compensation for them. Determining how skilful accident attorneys are is not rocket science however; it only requires looking out for certain traits or attributes.</p><p><b>Specialty</b></p><p>There are different types of accidents and each type is usually a specialty on its own and often requires attorney specialization. For instance, there are burn injuries, train accidents, birth injuries, industrial accidents and a host of others. In the same vein, there are different attorneys who specialize in each of these different types of accident cases. Thus, before hiring any accident attorney, be sure that he or she is specialized in the type of accident you were involved in. This affects the chances of getting adequate compensation for injuries sustained.</p><p><b>Litigation Experience</b></p><p>Apart from the attorney being specialized in a particular type of accident, he or she must have also spent a reasonable number of years litigating cases under it. For instance, you wouldn&#8217;t want to allow a fresh law school graduate to handle a case with the potential of getting you several thousands (or even millions) of dollars in compensation. You stand to benefit more from accident attorneys that have several years of litigation to their credit.</p><p><b>Professional Reputation</b></p><p>This is important when considering an accident attorney. A lawyer&#8217;s reputation precedes him or she and you should take the time to find out an attorney&#8217;s reputation before casting your lot with the practice. If an attorney is reputed to be abusive or disregards clients&#8217; wishes, you need to steer clear of such. An attorney with a reputation for losing cases should also be avoided. An attorney that has a reputation for being patient, considerate and wining large verdicts for clients comes well recommended.</p><p><b>Results</b></p><p>Accident attorneys must be able to prove that they can win large verdicts for clients and the tangible proof of this are the records of verdicts obtained in the past. This is not hard to find and an attorney with such will readily let you know of his or her verifiable exploits.</p><p /><p /><p /><p>Law Offices of Ledger &amp; Associates<br />811 Wilshire Blvd<br />Suite 1000<br />Los Angeles, CA 90017<br />Office: 213-493-6588<br />Toll Free 800-300-0001<br />Website: <a href="http://www.injurylawyergroup.com">www.injurylawyergroup.com</a></p><p /><!--more-->An attorney plays a significant role in the litigation of accident cases.

aS'<p>The <a title="Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Federal Disability Retirement" href="http://federaldisabilitylawyer.com/frequently-asked-questions.html" target="&#95;blank">question</a> has been posed: &#160;How can one <a title="See also the \'\'Office of Personnel Management\'\' and the \'\'Merit System Protection Board\'\'" href="http://www.fers-disability-retirement.com/" target="&#95;blank">Federal Agency</a> make a determination of disability while another, separate Agency can deny a determination of disability? Contained within that question, of course, is an answer of disability from each Federal Agency, which was further preceded by multiple questions requesting the agency to make a determination of disability. &#160;A simple answer to the question posed would be: &#160;Each Agency is independent and separate, and thus has the authority to make an independent determination. &#160;That is what is deemed a &quot;power&quot; answer. &#160;But there are further nuances of an answer which go beyond the mere authority or power of an agency to make a <a title="OPM&#8217;s basic eligibility criteria and some further comments" href="http://www.myfederalretirement.com/public/380.cfm?sd=129" target="&#95;blank">determination</a>. &#160;In preparing, formulating and filing a Federal Disability Retirement application under FERS or CSRS, the question of another agency\'s determination on disability is often asked: &#160;How can one...? &#160;The full answer to the question would require a complex analysis of the various laws, statutes and criteria, which would include the following: &#160;Each Federal agency which provides a particular disability benefit is mandated by a specific statutory authority which sets out a specific set of criteria, and is different from the statutory authority defining another agency\'s particular benefits; some legal criteria are based upon a determination of percentage ratings, while others are based upon employability or whether a particular kind of job can be performed. &#160;Given all of this, one may still &quot;cross the lines&quot; by <a title="Another related post: Legal Arguments" href="http://federaldisabilityretirement.wordpress.com/2010/02/01/opm-disability-retirement-legal-arguments-in-federal-postal-disability-claims/" target="&#95;blank">making arguments</a> utilizing statements from one agency, as persuasive authority in arguing for another agency\'s disability benefits. &#160;In crossing such lines, however, it is important to maintain the integrity of the role, the criteria, the specific citation of the law, and what Judges actually have stated concerning the extent and authority of the influence which one agency determination may have another another. &#160;Thus, if one attempts to cross the lines, do so with <a title="Starting from the basics: The U.S. Code that applies to Federal Employees seeking Disability Retirement" href="http://federaldisabilitylawyer.com/us-code.html" target="&#95;blank">knowledge and understanding of the law</a>.</p><p>Sincerely, Robert R.

aS'The Work Life Law Center at the University of California-Hastings College of Law has an excellent <a href="http://www.worklifelaw.org/">feature</a> on their website dedicated to Family Responsibilities Discrimination (&quot;FRD&quot;). For those of you who are unaware, Family Responsibilities Discrimination is employment discrimination against workers based on their family caregiving responsibilities.<br /><br />In Wisconsin, there isn\'t an <em>exact </em>claim known as an &quot;FRD claim, but, rather, <em>FRD</em> claims arise under Title VII as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (&quot;PDA&quot;) or under the Wisconsin Fair Employment Act (&quot;WFEA&quot;), which protect employees from disparate treatment because of &quot;sex&quot; or &quot;pregnancy,&quot; for example.<br /><br />One FRD case out of Wisconsin involved a sales manager whose supervisor admitted that, although she was qualified for promotion, he did not promote her because the sales manager had children and the supervisor assumed she would not want to relocate her family. The plaintiff in that case won a $1 million-plus Title VII jury verdict in the Western District of Wisconsin. (Lust v. Sealy Inc., 277 F. Supp. 2d 973 (W.D. Wis. 2003), affirmed as modified by 383 F.3d 580 (7th Cir. 2004). The Seventh Circuit reduced the amount of damages.)'

aS'<div class="entry">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>As a Clearwater personal injury attorney I am often asked, \r\n&#8220;Should I call the police to the scene of the accident?&#8221; Yes. Many \r\nreasons exist to call the police to the scene of an accident regardless \r\nof how minor the impact or damage is.<br />\r\nFirst, let&#8217;s talk about why people don&#8217;t call police to the scene. </p>\r\n<p>Obviously if you&#8217;re in a car accident, you were likely en route to a \r\ndestination. If you&#8217;re like me, you were probably running late. As a \r\nresult, we desire this to be over as quickly as possible. Many assume \r\nthat the presence of a police officer will result in an extended delay. \r\nSimply, this is not true. Generally, it only takes law enforcement a few\r\n minutes to make it out to the scene. An officer will do a quick report,\r\n and gather relevant information and witnesses. Secondly, people believe\r\n that it is bothersome to call a police officer for a minor collision. \r\nThis is not true. Police officers and other units under the control of \r\nthe police are employed for matters such as this. This is part of their \r\nduty. </p>\r\n<p>So, why should the police be called to the scene of every accident? \r\nTo document what happened. Inevitably, we want to trust that others will\r\n be honest and tell exactly what happened in the accident. However, many\r\n individuals will distort the facts in an effort to prevent an increase \r\nto the costs of their respective insurance premium. Without the accident\r\n documented correctly from law enforcement it will simply come down to \r\ntwo separate stories and the insurance carriers involved will incur \r\ndifficulty in determining who was actually liable. Secondly, a person \r\ncan claim to have never been in an accident or can provide a false name.\r\n Without police there to ensure the accident is documented properly, a \r\nperson can be lied to or given false information.</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, it is important for us to call the police to the scene\r\n of any accident we are involved in. This does not add considerable time\r\n to the resolution of the matter and the benefits far outweigh the \r\ninconveniences. The police can properly document the accident, \r\nillustrating you were not at fault. In addition, they might issue a \r\ncitation to the at fault party further solidifying you did not \r\ncontribute to said accident. Lastly, by using law enforcement you can \r\nguarantee a proper exchange of names and driver information. For all of \r\nthose reasons, it is imperative for each of us to call a police officer \r\nto the scene of every accident. </p>\r\n<p>- Bryan C.

If someone is injured, contact emergency medical personnel (911) immediately.  If someone is hurt in an accident, California law requires that the police be contacted within twenty four hours.  You can report an accident by dropping by a station and filling out a report.  You can also fill out a report online at the <a href="http://dmv.ca.gov/forms/sr/sr1.htm">DMV</a>.

The source at the center of this new treatment may surprise many people.&#160; Researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) are utilizing a modified form of the measles virus to treat patients suffering from malignant pleural mesothelioma.&#160; The coordinated study was prompted by the discovery that several patients with cancer that naturally acquired measles experienced a reduction in the size of their cancer tumors.<p /></p><p LINE-HEIGHT: 115%;

The mice that had mesothelioma and received the altered measles virus lived up to twice as long as those mice with mesothelioma that did not receive the injection.&#160; Due to these promising results, the medical professionals have been able to move forward and use the treatment in human patients in this clinical trial.<p /></p><p LINE-HEIGHT: 115%;

Eligible participants in the study will receive the genetically engineered measles virus via an intrapleural injection.&#160; If a patient does not experience any unacceptable toxic side effects and the disease does not progress, the patient can receive additional doses every 28 days for up to 6 cycles.&#160; The altered vaccine strain of the measles virus contains a type of radioactive iodine that will enable doctors to monitor the effects the virus has on the mesothelioma tumor through non-invasive imaging studies.<p /></p><p LINE-HEIGHT: 115%;

In addition, the researchers also anticipate that an anti-tumor immune response will be elicited that will cause additional damage to the mesothelioma tumor.&#160; Patients will continue to be monitored every 3 to 6 months for up to 5 years.<p /></p><p LINE-HEIGHT: 115%;

aS'<p>A prenuptial agreement is a contract entered into by the parties prior to a marriage or civil union. The content of a prenuptial agreement can vary widely, but commonly includes provisions for division of property and spousal support in the event of divorce or breakup of the marriage. They may also include terms for guardianship and the forfeiture of assets as a result of divorce on the grounds of adultery, cruelty or legal abandonment. Laws vary between states and countries on how to draft prenuptial agreements.&#160; In the United States prenuptial agreements are recognized in all fifty states, but must be drafted and executed properly.</p><p>More and more couples are signing prenuptial marriage agreements. The spouses are not just couples dealing with financial inequality or couples of great wealth. They are couples who want to put all their financial cards and related issues on the table before they walk down the aisle, often to avoid great expense and prolonged painful litigation should the marriage fail.&#160; The following is a partial list of pros regarding prenuptial agreements:</p><p>1.&#160; A premarital agreement can protect the inheritance rights of children and grandchildren from a previous marriage.<br />2.&#160; If you have your own business or professional practice, a premarital agreement can protect that interest so that the business or practice is not arbitrarily divided or unreasonably convoluted or subject to the control or involvement of your former spouse upon divorce.<br />3.&#160; &#160;If one spouse has significantly more debt than the other, a premarital agreement can protect the debt-free spouse from having to assume or be liable for the obligations of the other.<br />4.&#160; If you plan to give up a lucrative career after the marriage, a premarital agreement can ensure that you will be compensated for that sacrifice if the marriage does not last.<br />5.&#160; A premarital agreement can address more than the financial aspects of marriage, and can cover any of the details of decision-making and responsibility sharing to which the parties agree in advance.<br />6.&#160; A premarital agreement may limit or pre-structure, subject to court scrutiny, the amount of spousal support that one spouse will have to pay the other upon divorce.<br />7.&#160; A premarital agreement can protect the financial interests of older persons, persons who are entering into second or subsequent marriages, and persons with substantial wealth.</p><p>Prenuptial agreements are, at best, a partial solution to obviating some of the risks of marital property disputes in times of divorce.&#160; The following is a list of the possible pitfalls of a prenuptial agreement:</p><p>1.&#160; The agreement may require you to give up your right to inherit from your spouse&#8217;s estate when he or she dies. Under the law, you are entitled to a portion of the estate even if your spouse does not include such a provision in his or her will.<br />2.&#160; If you contribute to the continuing success and growth of your spouse&#8217;s business or professional practice by entertaining clients and taking care of the home, etc., thus allowing him or her to focus on professional endeavors, you may not be entitled to claim a share of the increase in value if you agree otherwise in a premarital agreement. Under the laws of many states, this increase in value would be considered divisible marital property.<br />3.&#160; Starting a relationship with a contract that sets forth the particulars of what will happen upon death or divorce can undermine the sense of trust one wishes for upon marriage.<br />4.&#160; As mentioned above, a contract can take the wind out of your emotional sails.<br />5.&#160; It can be difficult to accurately project into the future which potential issues should be addressed, and what may seem like an inconsequential compromise in the romantic premarital period may seem more monumental and burdensome in reality.<br />6.&#160; A low- or non-wage-earning spouse may not be able to sustain the lifestyle to which he or she has become accustomed during the marriage if the agreement substantially limits property division by the court or the amount of spousal support to which that spouse is entitled.<br />7.&#160; In the &#8220;honeymoon&#8221; stage of a relationship, one spouse may agree to terms that are not in his or her best interests because he or she is &#8220;too in love&#8221; to be concerned about the financial aspects and can&#8217;t imagine the union coming to an untimely end.</p><p>For professional legal counsel on prenuptial agreements in the DFW Metroplex area, contact Dallas family law attorney Mark Nacol.</p>'

While the \r\nattorney-client privilege protects communications between a client and \r\nhis or her attorney from disclosure before a court, confidentiality \r\nprotects a client from any information a client chooses to share with \r\nhis or her attorney.</p>\r\n<p><b>Policy</b></p>\r\n<p>Why is confidentiality such an integral aspect of legal \r\nrepresentation? The answer is trust&#8212;to effectively represent a client, \r\nan attorney needs the client&#8217;s complete trust. Think of it this way, we \r\nare all more willing to share information that may be embarrassing or \r\ndifficult to talk about with someone that we know we can trust. This is \r\nwhy attorneys are held to a high standard of protecting a client&#8217;s \r\nconfidential information.</p>\r\n<p><b>Confidences and Secrets</b></p>\r\n<p>With respect to client confidentiality, the definition of a secret is\r\n anything either the client has requested to be held in confidence or \r\nanything that, if told, would be detrimental to the client. Confidential\r\n information is any information related to the representation of the \r\nclient. Furthermore confidential client information can only come from \r\nthe client, whereas a client&#8217;s secrets can come from any source.</p>\r\n<p><b>Informed Consent</b></p>\r\n<p>Only the client can give permission for his/her confidential \r\ninformation to be released. A client may give permission by &#8220;informed \r\nconsent&#8221;. Informed consent requires the client to be made aware of the \r\ndrawbacks and consequences of allowing their information to be made \r\npublic. The client may also give a waiver in advance but must be fully \r\ninformed of how and for what purpose the disclosures will be made.  </p><!--more--><i>Client confidentiality is the foundation of the attorney client \r\nrelationship.

aS'Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Credit Counseling<p><br />\r\n Before you file your chapter 13 bankruptcy you will have to take a \r\ncredit counseling class to fulfill the requirements of taking <a href="http://cortrightlaw.com/chapter-13-bankruptcy-credit-counseling" title="chapter 13 bankruptcy credit counseling">Chapter 13\r\n Bankruptcy</a> credit counseling. There are actually two classes that are \r\nrequired to fulfill the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Credit Counseling \r\nrequirement. The first one is taken before you file and the second one \r\nis taken after you file but before your class closes. So in a chapter 13\r\n bankruptcy you do have more time to take the second class but I always \r\nrecommend completing it shortly after filing. If you fail to take the \r\nfirst credit counseling class and provide the required documentation \r\nyour case will be dismissed. If you fail to take the second credit \r\ncounseling class your case will be closed at the end without a \r\ndischarge. Both classes can be taken online for about $40 each and they \r\ntake about 2 hours to complete</p>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Credit Counseling<p>Chapter\r\n 13 Bankruptcies are fairly complicated and you really should retain an \r\nattorney to help you through the process. The Chapter 13 Bankruptcy \r\nTrustee will want some very specific information in a very specific \r\nformat, failure to provide it will result on dismissal of your Chapter \r\n13 Bankruptcy Filing.

Karlinsky, Richard J. Fidei, and Jennifer C. Erdelyi</p><p>With the Florida Legislature recently confirming the Oct. 2, 2008, legislative sunset of Florida\'s public records exemption for credit scoring methodologies and related trade secret information, some insurers may have reason to be uneasy.</p><p>Pending bills in the current legislative session would prohibit the use of credit scores or credit reports in insurance underwriting. Companion Senate and House bills would amend the Unfair Insurance Trade Practices Act to prohibit the charging of motor vehicle insurance premiums based on credit information, the refusal to insure or continue to insure based upon an individual\'s credit information, and the use of credit reports or credit scores in making rate and underwriting determinations.</p><p>In addition, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) has proposed rules to regulate this issue. The proposed rules require insurers to utilize methodologies furnished to the OIR and to provide statistical validation proving that the use of credit scoring does not result in a disproportionate impact on certain protected classes of individuals. Any 2009 legislation could affect the disposition and substance of these proposals, which are in the rule development stage.</p><p>Can a failure to pay bills on time reliably predict the likelihood that an individual would suffer losses, file insurance claims, or be a greater insurance risk than others? If so, then does the use of a consumer\'s credit score for underwriting purposes result in discrimination against people of certain racial, ethnic, or income groups? During the current session, the Florida Legislature will likely consider whether insurers should be permitted to continue to use a consumer\'s credit score for insurance underwriting purposes. The topic is one of great controversy at both the state and federal levels, and it should spark considerable debate.</p><p>Limits Already in Place</p><p>There has been a trend to eliminate or restrict the use of credit scoring in connection with the underwriting of personal lines insurance. This trend can be traced to a growing concern that credit scoring may be a proxy for discrimination, based on studies that have shown lower credit scoring to be more prevalent among individuals of certain racial, ethnic, and income groups. Forty-four states currently have laws or regulations limiting or conditioning the use of insurance credit scoring, and four states - California, Georgia, Hawaii, and Michigan - have effectively banned the use of credit scoring with respect to all or select lines of insurance.</p><p>Florida currently has in place a statute allowing the limited and conditional use of credit scoring for the underwriting and rating of personal lines motor vehicle and residential insurance. In part, insurers must comply with the law\'s notice requirements to applicants or insureds , and must not base the request for credit information upon race, income, national origin, or other protected factors.</p><p>However, concern over the use of credit reports and credit scoring in insurance underwriting has been escalating. The&#160; OIR\'s&#160; long-standing efforts related to its proposed rules appear to be reflective of the growing nationwide trend, and they raise fundamental arguments regarding the use of this underwriting mechanism. While difficult to predict because of the dynamic nature of the legislative process, the Florida Legislature may attempt to take the next step by possibly limiting, or prohibiting altogether, the use of insurance credit scoring.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) studied the effects of the use of credit-based insurance scores in a benchmark report released in 2007. The study concluded that credit scoring was a valid predictor of risk as it related to automobile insurance, and was not a proxy for discrimination, though the FTC recognized the prevalence of lower credit scores among certain racial and ethnic groups. Because of sharp criticism of the study and its findings, the FTC\'s research is continuing, and the agency recently ordered nine national insurers to provide information regarding their use of credit scoring for homeowners\' insurance.</p><p>In mid-March, Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty issued a statement in support of the decision by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to hold a hearing to examine how insurance credit scoring is affecting consumers in today\'s economic climate, reiterating his long-held position that allowing the use of credit scores in the underwriting process unfairly discriminates against minorities and low-income individuals.</p><p>Additionally, CFO Alex Sink recently expressed opposition to using credit scores when determining Florida auto insurance rates and availability, saying she was &quot;unimpressed&quot; by auto insurers\' explanations about their need to apply the practice.</p><p>Valid Rating Tool</p><p>General industry reaction has been that credit scoring is a reliable predictor of loss that allows insurers to more accurately and efficiently allocate and price individual risks. Insurers further counter that racial, ethnic, and income data is not normally made available to them, there is no intent to discriminate, and the use of credit scoring does not in fact discriminate. Insurers argue that the elimination of credit scoring as a factor in insurance underwriting would, in effect, subsidize higher risk insureds by increasing premiums charged to lower risk insureds .</p><p>A related issue and concern for insurers is the possibility of the release of sensitive proprietary information regarding their credit scoring models and methodologies, which may be filed with the OIR and open to public review. The sunsetting of the specific credit scoring public records exemption, along with issues related to possible discrimination and concerns about the predictive reliability of credit scoring, may have been a catalyst for the legislative proposal to ban insurance credit scoring.</p><p>There are also pending bills related to proprietary confidential business information, including trade secrets provided to a state agency, which could further affect public records exemptions for insurance credit scoring records.</p><p>Any possible action will have to be prioritized among Florida budgetary issues and a number of important insurance-related matters, including issues surrounding the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, Citizens Property Insurance Corp., workers\' compensation attorneys\' fees, and surplus lines matters.</p><p>All of these issues will be considered within the context of a difficult legislative environment with regard to the insurance industry and the recent announcement of State Farm Florida \'s plan to withdraw from the state.</p><p>The banning of insurance credit scoring would likely be regarded as the loss of a valuable tool by those insurers (most significantly, automobile) who use it in the rating process.</p><p>If prevented from considering credit scoring as a factor in their rate setting, these insurers may increase rates for some, and possibly a majority of, policyholders who benefited from high credit scores, and decrease rates for others. The resulting rate changes could have broad competitive ramifications and potentially affect the market share and policyholder profile of individual insurers.</p><p>If the issue is not decided during this session, then the use of credit scoring in the insurance arena is sure to foster additional significant study, debate, and possible legislative action in the foreseeable future.</p><p center">&#160;</p><!--more-->With the Florida Legislature recently confirming the Oct. 2, 2008, legislative sunset of Florida\'s public records exemption for credit scoring methodologies and related trade secret information, some insurers may have reason to be uneasy.'

aS'<p></p><p><p font: 90%/175% \'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',Verdana,sans-serif; letter-spacing: -1px;">A Michigan based taxpayer operated commercial vessels on the Great Lakes. The then applicable Single Business Tax (repealed effective the end of 2007) apportioned the company&#8217;s income to Michigan in proportion that its Michigan revenue miles bore to all of its revenue miles.</p><p font: 90%/175% \'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',Verdana,sans-serif; letter-spacing: -1px;">Taxpayer argued that revenue derived 3 miles beyond the Michigan shoreline were not Michigan revenue miles. The Court of Appeals (the state&#8217;s intermediate appellate court) held for the state.&#160;<em>Andrie, Inc. v. Department of Treasury</em>, Michigan Court of Appeals, No. 291758, Unpublished (February 11, 2011);<a color: rgb(102, 119, 85);" href="http://coa.courts.mi.gov/documents/opinions/final/coa/20110201&#95;c291758&#95;42&#95;291758.opn.pdf">http://coa.courts.mi.gov/documents/opinions/final/coa/20110201&#95;c291758&#95;42&#95;291758.opn.pdf</a>.</p><p font: 90%/175% \'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',Verdana,sans-serif; letter-spacing: -1px;">The Court said that &#8220;(a)s a general principle, a State may not tax value earned outside its borders.&#8221; It said that Michigan law provides for an apportionment formula for transportation companies based upon the number of revenue miles that a company does in the state for the year to the revenue miles done everywhere.</p><p font: 90%/175% \'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',Verdana,sans-serif; letter-spacing: -1px;">The taxpayer first argued that applying a revenue apportionment formula to it (apparently as opposed to the standard apportionment formulas applied to most businesses) violated its constitutional right to equal protection. The Court dismissed this challenge because it was rational to use a revenue mileage formula for apportioning the income of transportation companies.</p><p font: 90%/175% \'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',Verdana,sans-serif; letter-spacing: -1px;">The Court also dismissed the taxpayer&#8217;s federal constitution commerce clause argument that the revenue mile formula unfairly apportioned income to Michigan &#8220;because the &#8230; (Michigan) &#8230; apportionment formula &#8230; was created specifically to fairly apportion the tax based on each taxpayer&#8217;s activity in the state.&#8221;</p><p font: 90%/175% \'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',Verdana,sans-serif; letter-spacing: -1px;">The taxpayer then cited a 1987 case where a Michigan court held that the state had no sufficient nexus or connection to tax income earned by seamen working on vessels travelling on the Great Lakes. The Court did not find that case persuasive, principally because the seamen in that case were not Michigan residents; whereas the taxpayer &#8220;was not merely providing services on ships plying the Great Lakes, but instead was earning business income based on its services provided in the Great Lakes, and its primary place of business was in Muskegon, Michigan.&#8221;</p><p font: 90%/175% \'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',Verdana,sans-serif; letter-spacing: -1px;">After dismissing the above constitutional attacks, the Court dealt with the central issue of the case; whether revenue miles derived on the Great Lakes were earned &#8220;in Michigan&#8221;, within the meaning of the apportionment statute. The Court agreed with the taxpayer, that the United States Supreme Court considered the Great Lakes the &#8220;high seas&#8221; for purposes of the federal constitution&#8217;s grant of nonexclusive jurisdiction to federal courts to hear &#8220;admiralty and maritime&#8221; cases: &#8220;Nevertheless, the tax in question does not impermissibly interfere or intrude with the federal admiralty jurisdiction, and there is no indication that the admiralty authority would occupy the field and preempt a state from apportioning a tax based on travel on the high seas within a state&#8217;s boundaries.&#160;&#160; The authority to tax plaintiff is warranted based on plaintiff&#8217;s residence and primary location in Muskegon.&#8221;</p><p font: 90%/175% \'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',Verdana,sans-serif; letter-spacing: -1px;"><strong>Comment</strong>: The Court said at the outset that the statutory challenge was based upon revenue miles earned 3 miles beyond the Michigan shoreline. This attack must be based upon the old rule that measured a country&#8217;s jurisdiction up to 3 miles from its shoreline. The Court apparently held that revenue miles earned 3 miles beyond the Michigan shoreline were &#8220;in Michigan&#8221;. However, it never specifically discussed the 3 mile issue.</p></p>'

aS'Today, I received word of the approval last week of an I-130 visa petition on one of my <a href="http://www.bretzlaw.com/">law firm&#8217;s</a> same-sex marriage cases.&#160; This was welcome and momentous news for me, as well as for my clients, Mr. Alan Tulin (U.S. citizen petitioner) and his spouse Mr. Carlos Beserra Luis (Brazilian beneficiary).&#160;&#160; The approval came as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s landmark decision on June 26, 2013, in the case, United States v. Windsor, No. 12-307.&#160; The top court&#8217;s decision struck down Section 3 of the federal 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as unconstitutionally discriminatory.&#160; The section had arbitrarily (a) limited the meaning of the words &#8220;marriage&#8221; and &#8220;spouse&#8221; to refer to a legal union between one man and one woman and (b) caused the denial of federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples.&#160; The top court&#8217;s decision applies only to marriages performed or &#8220;celebrated&#8221; in the U.S. States (13 in total to date) plus the District of Colombia that have legalized same-sex marriages. &#160;<br /><br />The landmark case was originally filed by Edith Windsor in U.S. District Court.&#160; As a surviving spouse, she had sought a federal estate tax exemption.&#160; It was denied because her same-sex marriage was not recognized under DOMA.&#160; The Supreme Court decision overturning DOMA enabled the estate to qualify for the exemption.&#160; On the day of the decision, President Obama instructed his Cabinet to &#8220;review all relevant federal statutes to ensure this decision, including its implications for Federal benefits and obligations, is implemented swiftly and smoothly.&#8221;&#160;&#160; And so, although this case grew out of a federal estate tax issue, the top court&#8217;s decision impacted other areas of federal law governing benefits and protections previously denied to married same-sex couples.&#160;&#160; &#160;<br /><br />In the area of immigration law, what comes immediately to mind is that a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident in a same-sex marriage can now sponsor a spouse for a family-based immigrant visa.&#160; Even though a same-sex marital couple may live in a state that does not recognize their union, their marriage is legally valid for immigration purposes if it was performed or &#8220;celebrated&#8221; in a marriage equality state.&#160; My abovementioned clients&#8217; case is an example of this.&#160; Mr. Tulin and Mr. Beserra Luis were lawfully married in Massachusetts, but filed their visa petition from New Jersey which has not yet become a marriage equality state. <br /><br />Many other aspects of immigration law are positively affected by the top court&#8217;s decision.&#160; These include fiance/fiancee petitions, derivative immigration status, petitions previously denied solely due to DOMA, and a reduced residence period requirement for naturalization.&#160;&#160; On the other hand, there are some unfavorable consequences.&#160; In the case of family preference immigrant visas, those who previously qualified as &#8220;unmarried sons and daughters&#8221; of U.S. citizens due to non-recognition of their same-sex marriages would now fall into the category of &#8220;married sons and daughters&#8221; of U.S. citizens.&#160; This would subject them to a longer waiting period for an immigrant visa.&#160; What is more unfortunate is that those who previously qualified as &#8220;unmarried sons and daughters&#8221; of lawful permanent residents (LPR) due to non-recognition of their same-sex marriages would be rendered ineligible for a immigrant visa because LPRs are not legally able to sponsor married sons and daughters. &#160;<br /><br />However, other positives are waivers and forms of relief from removal requiring a qualifying relative.&#160; A waiver of inadmissibility based on extreme hardship to an immigrant&#8217;s USC or LPR spouse is now possible for married same-sex couples.&#160; A same-sex spouse will now have access to forms of relief of removal based on marriage that include adjustment of status, cancellation of removal, waivers under sections 212 (h) and (i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and VAWA protection.<br /><br />This article highlights some of the benefits afforded to married same-sex couples as a result of the Supreme Court&#8217;s landmark decision striking down Section 3 of DOMA.&#160; The article was provided by Bretz &amp; Coven, LLP, which <a href="http://www.bretzlaw.com/">practices immigration law in New York City </a>and throughout the United States.&#160; For more in-depth information and advice on this and other immigration matters, contact Senior Partner, Kerry Bretz at <a href="http://www.bretzlaw.com/contact">http://www.bretzlaw.com/contact</a>.<br /><br />'

aS"&#160;&#160; In Illinois, the courts hold&#160; domestic violence civil order of \r\nprotection proceedings over persons who have had a dating or familial \r\nrelationship. The courts now also hold civil stalking no contact \r\nproceedings for persons who have not had such a relationship but where \r\nconduct is alleged to have reached the level of stalking.<br />&#160;&#160; The&#160; legislative purpose of the 740 ILCS 21 is to deter a\r\n course of conduct, not a single act.  &quot;Stalking  behavior includes \r\nfollowing a person, conducting surveillance of the  person, appearing at\r\n the person's home, work or school, making unwanted  phone calls, \r\nsending unwanted emails or text messages, leaving objects  for the \r\nperson, vandalizing the person's property, or injuring a pet.   Stalking\r\n is a serious crime.  Victims experience fear for their safety,  fear \r\nfor the safety of others and suffer emotional distress.  Many  victims \r\nalter their daily routines to avoid the persons who are stalking  them. \r\n Some victims are in such fear that they relocate to another  city, town\r\n or state.  While estimates suggest that 70% of victims know  the \r\nindividuals stalking them, only 30% of victims have dated or been in  \r\nintimate relationships with their stalkers.&quot;<br />&#160;&#160; The proceedings\r\n and protections mirror many of the provisions of the domestic violence \r\norder of protection act. Both parties are entitled to hire counsel to \r\nrepresent their respective interests. The orders are meant to \r\nprovide protection for individuals who present sufficient evidence to \r\nthe court. Since this is a civil, not a criminal proceeding, the \r\nstandard of the burden of proof is by a preponderance of evidence, not \r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the act prohibits mutual stalking \r\nno contact orders.<br /><p>&#160;&#160;&#160; Although intentional violation of a no \r\ncontact stalking order is a Class A misdemeanor with a second or \r\nsubsequent violation a Class 4 felony, other criminal charges such as \r\nStalking or Aggravated Stalking may also be lodged in particular \r\nsituations.\r\n</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160; If you have questions on this issue or about any Illinois criminal justice matter, contact Lori Levin at 312-972-3756 or levin@lorilevinlaw.com. </p><p></p>"

aS'<p><strong>&quot;How do we establish paternity of our child in Indiana?  We \r\nlove each other, but are not married and want to make sure we do it \r\nright and give our baby the dad&#8217;s name.&quot;</strong></p>\r\n<p>At Ciyou &amp; Dixon, we have handled virtually every type of <a href="http://www.ciyoudixonlaw.com/paternity/">Indiana paternity</a>\r\n case, from the straightforward in establishing paternity to the novel \r\nand unusual, such as challenging DNA results.  The area is fairly \r\ntechnical since the legal system evolved around the traditional model of\r\n a married man and wife and family, and child born in wedlock.</p>\r\n<p>For this reason, the father of the child has no legal rights or \r\nobligations (unlike the father of a child born in wedlock) until \r\npaternity is established.  Under Indiana law, a putative father&#8217;s \r\npaternity can only be established in one of two ways.  The most common \r\nis by a father executing a paternity affidavit upon the child&#8217;s birth. \r\nThe other is by a lawsuit under the paternity act.</p>\r\n<p>It is only when paternity is established that a father may seek \r\nphysical and/or legal custody. In addition, there is no legal duty for a\r\n putative father to sign a paternity affidavit or agree to paternity.  \r\nThe way paternity is established when a father is unwilling to accept \r\nparentage or when the parties are unsure who the father of the child is,\r\n is by genetic testing.</p>\r\n<p>Genetic testing is usually a straightforward process. Each party has a\r\n saliva swab taken to the official source providing the service for the \r\ncourt.  If a man is a child&#8217;s father, it will be established by a \r\ngreater than 99% probability.  In certain cases, even the paternity test\r\n may be challenged. What is clear is that a store-bought paternity test \r\nis not sufficient to establish paternity.</p>\r\n<p>After paternity is legally established and a custody and support \r\norder is issued by the court, the case proceeds and tracks the process \r\nin much the same way as a divorce case. The Indiana <a href="http://www.ciyoudixonlaw.com/child-support/">Child Support</a> Rules and Guidelines are used to establish child support and its modifications. The <a href="http://www.ciyoudixonlaw.com/family-law/child-custody/indiana-parenting/">Indiana Parenting Time Guidelines</a> govern parenting time.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, modifications of physical and legal custody and child \r\nsupport follow different, but identical, statutory provisions to divorce\r\n matters.  In other words, the same facts that establish a modification \r\nin a divorce case should result in the same outcome in a paternity case.\r\n  There are some slight differences, but a skilled advocate can navigate\r\n around these (such as provisions for a custody evaluation and attorney \r\nfee award).</p>\r\n<p>Again, because paternity involves a child born out of wedlock, the \r\nrules are technical. For instance, a father who desires a relationship \r\nwith a child he believes is his, must file a paternity action within two\r\n years of the child&#8217;s birth, or he is barred under the Paternity Act.  \r\nAs a parent, if paternity issues are what you face, you should retain \r\nknowledgeable counsel to help you navigate these complicated legal \r\nrules.</p>\r\n<p>The consequences for technical failures are often severe, ranging \r\nfrom estopping a father from filing a paternity action to denying a \r\nchild of a relationship with his father and the child support that might\r\n yield.  Know your facts, and work with counsel to meet the child&#8217;s best\r\n interests. The paternity lawyers at Ciyou &amp; Dixon are skilled \r\nattorneys and are here to help.</p><!--more-->At Ciyou &amp; Dixon, we have handled virtually every type of Indiana paternity\r\n case, from the straightforward in establishing paternity to the novel \r\nand unusual, such as challenging DNA results.

aS'<div>Vehicle technology designed to prevent people from driving while intoxicated has made great strides in recent years. In fact, some people believe that within the next decade, cars will have alcohol sensors that eliminate drunk driving altogether. Machines have been developed that can read blood-alcohol content via a fingerprint scan, and eye scan, and a person&#8217;s sweat. <br /><br />For those in Northern Virginia, a&#160;<a href="http://www.thomashwilsonlaw.com/"><strong>Manassas DUI lawyer</strong></a> could be a knowledgeable resource in the various types of technologies available for current use. <br /><br />One current&#160;<a href="http://www.thomashwilsonlaw.com/Firm%20Info/Practice%20Areas/DUI%20and%20DWI.aspx">DUI</a> prevention technology called an <a href="http://www.dadss.org/">ignition interlock</a> requires drivers to give a breath sample every time they start their cars. If the technology detects any trace of alcohol, the car will not start. Although this approach has been highly successful in preventing convicted drunk drivers from repeating their actions, it is not appropriate for the general public. Those who do not drink or do not drink and drive feel that the technology is unnecessary and intrusive. <br /><br />As the search continues to create a technology that is more realistic for widespread use, some of the qualities that researchers and technicians are looking for include: </div><div><ul><li>Accuracy</li><li>Cost-effectiveness</li><li>Maintenance-free</li><li>Not intrusive</li></ul><p />What people think Studies show that a majority of Americans support advancements in vehicle technology that could prevent drivers from driving while intoxicated. In 2006, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Auto Alliance, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety came together to create a <a href="http://www.madd.org/Drunk-Driving/Drunk-Driving/Campaign-to-Eliminate-Drunk-Driving/Advanced-Technology.aspx">panel on advanced alcohol detection technology</a>. Their collaborative research will explore the potential benefits of alcohol detection technologies, as well as their overall feasibility and any public policy changes that might arise because of their use. <br /><br />Some potential methods of DUI prevention these groups are exploring include: <ul><li>Touch-based systems to measure blood alcohol levels through the skin</li><li>Visible light that could measure blood alcohol levels through spectroscopy</li><li>Various eye movement measurement technologies</li><li>A more advanced method of breath testing</li></ul><p>Although studies estimate that the creation of an accessible and non-intrusive advanced alcohol detection technology for vehicles could prevent up to 9,000 automobile accident deaths each year, unfortunately, that technology is not available at this moment.

aS'<p>What is Premises Liability?</p><p>Property owners and occupiers have a duty to protect people who are on their property from injuries. When property owners fail to protect people from potentially hazardous conditions, they are held accountable. This is the concept of premises liability.</p><p>What should a victim of premises liability do after an injury? Document the condition of the property &#8211; take photographs that show the physical characteristics of the height, width, depth of the problem area before any potential repairs can be made.</p><p>Victim&#8217;s rights as they related to premises liability vary from state to state. For example, in Missouri, property owners are legally bound to provide a reasonably safe condition of property or, at minimum, warn that the conditions of the premises may be unsafe. Negligent property owners must pay the victim damages, which can include medical expenses, pain and suffering and loss of current and potential wages.</p><p>Businesses are often required to carry premises liability insurance &#8211; but insurance companies are looking out for their best interests, not yours.

Alimony is based on one parties need and \r\nthe others ability to pay.  The moving party must prove a &#8220;substantial change in \r\ncircumstance&#8221; in their petition for modification.  A &#8220;substantial change in \r\ncircumstance&#8221; may include, one party losing their job or making significantly \r\nless money, or a salary increase. </p><p>\r\n</p><p>            <strong><a title="Child Support" href="http://www.winstonlawpa.com/family-law/child-support">Child Support</a>. \r\n</strong> If the financial circumstances of either party change, child support \r\ncan be legally modified upon a showing of a &#8220;substantial change of \r\ncircumstance.&#8221;  Such circumstances may include, one party losing their job, one \r\nparty making significantly more or less money, or daycare and health insurance \r\nchanges.  It is important to note that the change in financial circumstances \r\nmust not be voluntary.

The NRP (National Reassessment Program) is simply a macrocosmic approach of a large agency (the U.S. Postal Service), mirroring a microcosmic approach (the approach of most agencies towards individual Federal or Postal employees who have a medical condition which prevents him or her from performing one or more of the essential elements of one\'s job) in dealing with &quot;less than fully productive&quot; Federal or Postal employees.&#160; Then, of course, there is the intersecting issue of filing for Social Security Disability benefits, which you have to do anyway, under FERS -- but whether one actually gets it, is another issue.&#160; All of these issues intersect; rarely are these issues isolated; the consequential impact of all of these issues need to be viewed in a macro manner.</p><p>Sincerely, Robert R.

aS'<p>Tort law is a fancy name for the civil wrongdoing of others. These include personal injury cases and other wrongdoings where someone is directly at fault for another person\'s physical, legal, or economic harm. Holding these people accountable generally results in a lawsuit claim that is filed by the wronged party, depending on the type of case that occurs. Tort is divided into three basic categories; intentional torts, liability torts, and negligent torts. Most cases that are filed in civil court are designated as negligence or liability, although intentional cases are seen, as well. </p>\r\n<p>Negligent tort law covers cases where someone has fault from sheer accident. For example, a company might not be directly liable for your slip and fall injury if there was ice in the parking lot, but they are negligent because they could have fixed the situation so that you didn\'t fall in the first place. Intentional tort is a case where someone meant to do wrong and did so effectively. This includes running a company improperly, manufacturing dangerous products, and other types of cases where someone intentionally did something that harmed another person. Finally, there are liability torts. Product liability is the biggest case here. Such is an example when you use a knife according to the directions and still manage to cut your finger off. This is strict liability on behalf of the product manufacturer and they need to be held accountable.</p>\r\n<p>Working with tort law is what <a href="http://www.getmejustice.com/" target="&#95;blank">personal injury lawyers</a> do best. Their job is specifically to understand the different types of cases that can occur and what they can do to help you get the best outcome when you are involved with this type of case. A tort can cause physical, emotional, economic, or legal damage. It doesn\'t always have to be an actual injury, but in most cases it will be. Defamation, trespassing, and other issues are also considered under tort law. </p>\r\n<p>It\'s going to be up to you to learn about tort law and how it affects your case, no matter what type of situation you are in. The world of tort law is basically about holding someone responsible for the injury or damage caused to another. There are thousands of lawyers who specialize in this type of law and can help people get the settlements and victories that they deserve from a case like this, no matter what actually occurred or who was at fault. </p><!--more-->Tort law is a fancy name for the civil wrongdoing of others.

aS'<p>&#160;In 1994, 20 years after taking the bar examination, I applied for Board Certification as a criminal trial specialist with the National Board of Trial Advocacy (NBTA). The process was involved. In order to qualify I had to prove the extent of my involvement as lead counsel in a substantial number of jury trials (fortunately they don&#8217;t ask for wins and losses). Peer references from judges before whom I practiced as well as lawyers against whom I tried cases together with proof of 45 hours of continuing legal education as well as a writing sample was also required. Finally one had to pass a written examination. The test lasted 6 hours, something I had not endured since the bar exam. Recertification is necessary every 5 years, with just as rigorous a review.<br />As I write this I am now undergoing the process of seeking certification as a civil trial lawyer as well. While the number of Board certified lawyers in our state is growing, only three members of the Connecticut Bar presently possess certification in both criminal and civil trial law. I remember sitting for the exam in 1994 with a 2 year old that was up all night cutting teeth. Twenty years prior I had the same experience with his older brothers the night before the bar exam. Fortunately we have run out of teething children, so hopefully I can approach this upcoming exam on a full night&#8217;s sleep.<br />&#160;Specialty certification has long been a hallmark of excellence in specific areas of medical and dental practice. It was a long time coming to the law but serves consumers well. With the advent of lawyer advertising, selecting a truly qualified trial advocate became a crapshoot. Traditionally, consumers found the better advocates through word of mouth and referral from the family lawyer. In 1977 the United States Supreme Court relaxed the ethical prohibition on lawyer advertising, citing that such restrictions violated the First Amendment. What followed was an explosion of TV, radio, and print ads. Busses and taxis extolled the prowess of countless lawyers, whose only real claim to expertise was the size of their advertising budget.<br />That same year Bridgeport lawyer, Theodore Koskoff founded NBTA, dedicated to bettering the quality of trial advocacy and assisting consumers in finding experienced and highly qualified trial lawyers. The late Ted Koskoff was an icon of the bar, not only in this state but nationally as well, having established one of the country&#8217;s premier personal injury law firms. NBTA was housed, and fully supported by the Association of Trial Lawyers of America until its move to Boston in 1987. Specialty certification was available in the fields of civil and criminal trial practice. It later expanded to include family law and now social security disability law as well.<br />&#160;NBTA has now changed its name to the National Board of Legal Specialty Certification and is accredited by the American Bar Association. Specialty certification is also now offered in social security disability law. Consumers can locate an attorney who has undergone this rigorous testing and approval process through the NBLSC website, <a href="http://www.nblsc.us">http://www.nblsc.us</a>.<br />&#160;Specialty certification is not necessary to practice trial law, but is, required for a lawyer to advertise expertise in that field. There are many outstanding trial lawyers who have simply not taken the time or seen the need to obtain specialty certification. There is a growing national movement to require such certification, but it has not reached our state as yet. Consumers looking for the highest level of representation should at least search the NBLSC site for recommendations. Hopefully I&#8217;ll make this next cut as well.</p><p>Richard T.

aS'<p><br />Below are some frequently asked questions and answers about divorce in Georgia.</p><p><b>What is a divorce?&#160;</b></p><p>It is a term used to describe the legal termination of a marriage. When filing divorce papers in a fault divorce, each spouse must state a reason for wanting to terminate the marriage. Georgia state law recognizes twelve such reasons, which include mental or physical cruelty, drug addiction, and conviction for certain crimes. For a no-fault divorce, one spouse simply needs to state that the marriage is irretrievably broken.</p><p><b>What is no-fault divorce?&#160;</b></p><p>It is when the spouse seeking the divorce does not have to prove that the other partner did something wrong. </p><p><b>What is a fault divorce?&#160;</b></p><p>This occurs when one party blames the other for causing the divorce. </p><p><b>Do I have to involve the court to get a divorce?&#160;</b></p><p>Yes, because marriage is a legal bond. Therefore, if a person desires a divorce, he or she has to get the courts involved.&#160;</p><p><b>What are the first steps taken in court for a divorce?&#160;</b></p><p>You must file a summons, which is a legal document that notifies your spouse of your intentions. Next, you need to file a petition that asserts specific claims against your spouse and outlines what you request from the court. </p><p><b>How long does a divorce usually take?&#160;</b></p><p>Every divorce is different, so the time for each divorce varies. Typically, a divorce takes anywhere from 31 days to a couple of years. When a judge signs the divorce decree, then the divorce is officially final. </p><p><b>What is the duration of residency to obtain a divorce in Georgia?&#160;</b></p><p>Six months or 180 days.&#160;</p><p><b>Can my spouse and I use the same attorney when going through a divorce?</b></p><p>No. One attorney cannot ethically represent both individuals involved in a divorce case, since a divorce action involves two people with complete conflicts of interest. </p><p><b>Can a spouse prevent the courts from granting a divorce?&#160;</b></p><p>It depends on the type of divorce the other spouse seeks. The other individual cannot stop a no-fault divorce. A fault divorce, on the other hand, can be challenged by the spouse not seeking the divorce. The individual must go to court to prove that he or she is actually not at fault. If proven, then the fault divorce could be defeated.</p><p><b>What is collaborative divorce?</b></p><p>In a collaborative divorce, the attorneys for both sides agree to assist their clients in resolving conflicts by employing cooperative techniques rather than adversarial strategies and litigation. All the people involved commit themselves to achieving a negotiated outcome. It is agreed that no litigation will commence during the negotiations.</p><p><b>What are the advantages of collaborative divorce?</b></p><p>The most obvious benefit is the reduction in stress and emotional trauma. Here, both sides work together in a private setting to come up with a mutually beneficial resolution. </p><p><b>The right attorney can help you with your Georgia divorce</b></p><p>The dissolution of your marriage is a stressful event.

If you find a business you want to buy, you want to be able to move ahead with an offer.</p><p>Determine why the current owner is selling. This could raise a red flag or encourage you to look into the business further.</p><p>Determine what is required for licenses and permits, zoning observances, and environmental obligations. </p><p>Carefully study the company&#8217;s financial status. Ask the current owner for copies of the company&#8217;s last three years of financial statements and tax returns. Find out what types of loans are outstanding. </p><p>Find out if the current owner is willing to stay and work with you through a transition period. Talk to employees to find out what they think about the business and its potential. If current managers and employees aren&#8217;t aware of a possible sale, find out why. </p><p>Investigate product quality and customer service standards. Make it a point to interview current and previous customers.</p><p>Ask suppliers about the quality of their relationship with the current company&#8217;s owner and if they&#8217;re paid on time.</p><p>Check into employee turnover; it&#8217;s generally a sign of how the business is run and the strength of its reputation in the community.</p><p>Take a close look at the physical structure, equipment, furnishings and cleanliness of the business.

Although, many surgical procedures have\r\ninherent risks and complications to surgical procedures, there are many\r\nunfortunate injuries and deaths that are caused due to surgical errors. A\r\ncareful analysis of the medical records is necessary to determine whether an\r\ninjury or death was caused by medical malpractice or whether it was an inherent\r\nrisk of the surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 13.5pt;" class="MsoNormal">In a recent issue of <u>Annals of Surgery</u> published\r\nin 2009, researchers performed an in-depth analysis to determine a source of\r\nmany of the major medical errors reported by surgeons. In the article, &#8220;<b><i>Burnout\r\nand Medical Errors Among American Surgeons</i></b>,&#8221; the researchers performed\r\na detailed analysis of a variety of potential factors relating to surgical\r\nerrors. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter compiling data and performing an intensive statistical analysis, the\r\nresearchers determined that, &#8220;<i>Many major medical errors reported by surgeons\r\nare strongly related to a surgeon&#8217;s degree of burnout and their mental quality\r\nof life</i>.&#8221; The researchers recommended that additional studies are needed to\r\ndetermine how to reduce the surgeon distress and what the medical profession\r\ncan do to support surgeons when medical errors do, in fact, occur. </p>\r\n\r\n<p margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 13.5pt;" class="MsoNormal">Surgeons notoriously work significant hours every day\r\nperforming difficult and intensive surgical procedures. Their training in\r\nmedical school and during their medical residency is exhaustive. There is a\r\nsignificant amount of stress in their work due to the intensity of their jobs\r\nand the demands of their profession. It is not surprising that many surgeons\r\nsuffer from burnout as a result of being overworked and overstressed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, on other occasions patients suffer significant injuries and even death\r\ndue to medical errors made by surgeons. The cause of those errors is not always\r\nknown, however, this report indicates that a major cause may be the burnout of\r\nthe surgeons themselves. When this occurs, the innocent patient is the victim\r\nof this burnout. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is clear that the medical profession needs to do a better job of reducing\r\nthe stress of surgeons and providing more workable schedules. These and other\r\nactions may reduce surgeon burnout and prevent future medical errors that\r\njeopardize the lives and safety of surgery patients.</p><p margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 13.5pt;" class="MsoNormal">If you or a family member suffer injuries due to a surgical error, you may have means for a Michigan medical malpractice lawsuit.

When the officers went to arrest Campos, he got into a car, backed up and hit Pinon. <p />Pinon was pulled under the car and had one wheel drive over his collarbone, just missing his head, officials said. <p /><p>Campos, who prosecutors said was a member of the Norteno gang, was also found guilty of possession of methamphetamine for sale.</p><p>If you or a loved on has been accused of assault with a deadly weapon or any crime, You may need a <a title="Salinas Criminal Attorney" href="http://www.biegellawoffice.com/contact/">Salinas Criminal Attorney</a>.&#160; Contact the <a href="http://www.biegellawoffice.com/criminal-law/">Monterey County Criminal Defense Attorneys</a> at The Biegel Law Firm for immediate help.&#160; (877) 223-8982.</p><!--more-->A known Salinas gang member was found guilty Thursday of assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer.'

It can include failure to train individuals in the proper handling of dangerous materials, failure to provide necessary safety equipment, or failure to provide a safe environment. If inadequate security allowed an intruder to commit a crime, the owner and manager of the property in question may be held liable.</li><li><b>Statute of limitations.</b> Louisiana wrongful death law requires that a personal injury lawsuit (which includes wrongful death) be filed within one year of the incident. Some exceptions are possible, but this clearly shows the need to act quickly.</li><li><b>Compensation.</b> Family members can sue for the loss of present and future wages, expenses related to emergency healthcare, funeral expenses, loss of consortium (for a surviving spouse), and mental anguish.</li></ul><p>The nature of every wrongful death case, however, is that no two incidents are the same.

aS'\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">If you have ever had the embarrassing experience of falling in a\r\nstore or in a parking lot there is a belief that you can file a negligence case\r\nagainst the store or commercial property owner and automatically receive a\r\nmoney settlement.&#160; However, the law in New\r\nJersey says not so fast.&#160;&#160; </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">&#160;&#160; </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">Most people have either seen a family member or friend slip or\r\ntrip and fall or have fallen themselves.&#160;\r\nAlthough your initial reaction might be to laugh to see someone fall or\r\nbe embarrassed if you fell, many times a fall can result in severe injuries\r\nwith long lasting effects on a person&#8217;s life and work. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" "> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">For example assume that you were holiday shopping inside a big\r\nname department store and you slipped and fell on some kind of liquid on the\r\nfloor.&#160; Obviously you would not have\r\nfallen had you seen the liquid before you fell so your initial reaction will be\r\nthat the store was at fault and that you can sue the store&#8217;s insurance company.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" "> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">However, just as you have the right to sue, the store has rights\r\nestablished by New Jersey law as well.&#160;\r\nSpecifically, the store has a duty to inspect their premises and floors\r\nbut has a reasonable amount of time to do so.&#160;\r\nIn our example let&#8217;s say that the liquid on the floor was from a bottle\r\nof water that another customer brought into the store and accidentally spilled\r\nit ten seconds before you fell.&#160; If a\r\nslip and fall negligence case is filed in court, the store will argue that they\r\ndid not cause the water spill that caused you to fall and they did not have a\r\nreasonable amount of time to clean up the spill or have a reasonable amount of\r\ntime to inspect their floors to find the spill.&#160;\r\nUnder this set of facts, even if your injuries were life changing, the\r\njudge assigned to the case would dismiss your case against the store because\r\nthe store did not have enough notice or time to clean up the spill.&#160; As unfair as this may seem, the store is entitled\r\nto legal protection from the courts under these facts.&#160; </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">If the spill happened one hour before your entered the store and\r\nyou were shopping in the aisle of the spill for a half hour or so and then you\r\nslipped and fell, the store cannot argue that they did not know about the spill\r\nbecause they have a duty to clean up the spill within a reasonable time based\r\nupon their duty to inspect their floors.&#160;\r\nYou can make the argument that if no employee from the store came into\r\nyour aisle for the half hour that you were in the aisle that the store was\r\nnegligent in failing to inspect their floors within a reasonable period of\r\ntime.&#160; The same argument would apply if\r\nyou fell in a hole in the store parking lot.&#160;\r\nHoles develop over a period of time so the store cannot argue that they\r\nwere not aware the hole was there.&#160; The\r\nstore has a duty to inspect and repair the hole.&#160; </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" "> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">In another example if the liquid spill came from a leaking\r\nrefrigerator inside the store, the store cannot claim that they did not know\r\nabout the spill or did not have time to clean it up because the store created\r\nthe condition that caused you to fall.&#160;\r\nIn these types of cases you do automatically have a right to file a slip\r\nand fall negligence case.&#160; </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" "> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" "><b><i>What should you do if you fall?</i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" "> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">You should report your accident to a store manager.&#160; If available, you should use your cell phone\r\nto take pictures of the area where you fell to preserve the condition that\r\ncaused you to fall or to show that there were no warning cones in the area\r\nand/or that the area had not been properly maintained.&#160; You can also write down what happened because\r\nyour memory can fade over time.&#160; Be very\r\nspecific about what you fell on or how big an area the spill was.&#160; &#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">For snow and ice cases, you have to prove that the condition was\r\nthere for a period of time and that it was not salted or sanded or otherwise\r\nplowed/cleared.&#160; Your attorney can obtain\r\nweather reports showing the weather conditions at the time of your fall and can\r\nobtain information from the store as to inspection schedules or salting/sanding\r\nprocedures set by the store.&#160; </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" "> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">If you slip and fall while you are working you have the right to\r\nfile a workers&#8217; compensation case and may have the right to file a negligence\r\ncase against the owner of the property where you fell if a negligent condition\r\ncaused you to fall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" "> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">As in everything there are exceptions in slip and fall\r\ncases.&#160; If you fall on residential\r\nproperty your rights are limited.&#160; If you\r\nfall on publicly owned property such as a public school or a municipal building\r\nor parking lot or if you fall on church property then there is extra and\r\nsubstantial protection that the public entity or religious institution receives\r\nunder the law.&#160;

Some of them involve serious injuries while others are merely considered fender benders.

One driver will be the victim and the other in the wrong but they both deserve to be represented well and by a qualified attorney well versed in California traffic laws.</p><p><b>Inattention is often to blame for traffic accidents</b></p><p>While certain mechanical problems may cause a traffic accident, most of the time it is the fault of one driver due to inattention to what is happening on the road ahead. Cell phone talk and texting have become a big problem with drivers and have been banned in many areas of the country. If the victim&#8217;s lawyer can prove the other driver was distracted due to texting on their cell phone both judge and jury will most likely want extensive restitution for the innocent driver, especially if there were injuries involved.</p><p><b>Insurance providers often delegate the degree of fault and compensation</b></p><p>Many automobile insurance providers today prefer to delegate the amount of blame among the drivers. When one party is at fault because they were driving while under the influence or DWI, the insurer may well decide he or she is totally at fault and proclaim the other party be awarded 100% of the money they are due. The guilty party will then be charged, through his or her insurance provider, for total restitution and when that involves medical bills, the amount can be substantial. A good Los Angeles auto accident attorney will be familiar with the laws and also with how most insurance providers handle situations and can advise their clients as to how to proceed.</p><p><b>Medical expenses add up for the innocent drivers</b></p><p>When an accident occurs there is typically one driver more at fault than the other. When injuries are involved the drivers and passengers of both automobiles may need medical attention. Accident investigators will determine who was at fault based on evidence left at the scene of the wreck. This information is passed on to the insurance providers and each driver should obtain a good car accident attorney who will then help the drivers with their legal obligations and any criminal charges that may arise due to negligence by one or both of the drivers</p><p>Law Offices of Ledger &amp; Associates<br />811 Wilshire Blvd<br />Suite 1000<br />Los Angeles, CA 90017<br />Office: 213-493-6588<br />Toll Free 800-300-0001<br />Website: <a href="http://www.injurylawyergroup.com">www.injurylawyergroup.com</a></p><!--more-->That could be a newspaper headline because there are plenty of auto accidents in and around the LA area.

Bar associations, law schools and other astute organizations have come up with draft laws called model and uniform acts. You might have heard of Model Corporation Acts and Uniform Partnership Acts. These acts are not laws (only legislatures can pass laws, remember), but they often become laws when adopted by state legislatures. They have been around for a long time because we now have Revised Model Corporation Acts and Revised Uniform Partnership Acts that have been adopted in many, if not most, states. </p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">Of course, some state laws differ more than others. Especially Louisiana, whose law is based on French law. The law of other states was based on English common law, which is generally considered to be the law in effect in England in 1776. Yes, 1776. Over 200 years ago. </p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">There were not many corporations back then.

aS'The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (11 U.S.C. &#167;547) defines the ninety days prior to the date an individual debtor files for bankruptcy as the preference period.&#160; A debtor may request that a creditor return any money collected during the preference period.&#160; The question then becomes does a creditor always have to return the money?&#160; The answer is not always. <br /><br />The Act discusses several instances in which creditor may not have to return the money. One such instance is when the amount of money collected from a debtor (with primarily consumer debts) during the preference period is less than $600 (11 U.S.C. &#167;547(c)(8)). The United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware has yet to address the question of whether creditors may keep any money below $600 collected during the preference period and only need to return funds in excess of $600 or whether to join the majority and find that $600 is a threshold amount. Meaning, if a creditor has received $600 or more during the preference period the creditor must return the whole amount collected.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;<br /><br />Clark C.

No matter how friendly the insurance adjuster may seem, beware of any initial settlement offers. In an effort to close the claim quickly and cheaply, insurance companies often pressure car accident victims into accepting a low settlement. Most initial insurance company settlement offers are below the true value of damages. Some victims may not realize their claim is worth far more than what the insurance company is offering them. Once a settlement offer has been accepted, victims will be denied the opportunity to pursue legal action in the future. </p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">If you are being pressured into accepting a settlement by an insurance adjuster, do not hesitate to speak to a reputable <a href="http://www.elkgrovecaraccidents.com/">Elk Grove car accident lawyer</a>.

aS'<p>\r\n\r\nTelemarketing scams are one of the most common financial crimes which target elderly citizens.&#160; In fact, according to the American Association of Retired People (AARP) one out of six consumers fall victim to telemarketing scams each year, for an estimated total of over $40 billion.&#160; Furthermore, around 80% of these victims are elders.&#160; There are several reasons as to why scam artists target the elderly, and several common scams to be aware of.&#160; However, it is important to know that law makers are aware of this epidemic, and that the laws are on your side.&#160; Further, if you or your loved ones have fallen victim to such scams, <a href="www.burnsattorneys.com">an experienced trial attorney</a> can help you and your loved ones secure the justice that you deserve.</p><p>Scam artists target elder citizens for a variety of reasons.&#160; One reason is that elder citizens are thought to be friendlier and more willing to talk to telemarketers than others.&#160; Another reason is that elders tend to be more patriotic and respectful towards authority.&#160; Telemarketers take advantage of this by pretending to be associated with the government.&#160; Perhaps the most troubling reason that scam artists target elders, however, is that elders are often embarrassed to admit that they have fallen victim to these schemes.&#160; Yet many of these scam artists are highly sophisticated and, simply put, really good at what they do.&#160; Thus, if you have fallen victim to one of these common schemes, there is nothing to be embarrassed about.&#160; Further, if you suspect that one of your loved ones has fallen victim, there are several indicators to look out for, including: (1) unusual bank activity or withdrawals of large sums of money, (2) disappearance of funds or possessions, (3) entry forms and prizes from contests, and (4) payments made for &quot;free&quot; merchandise or vacations.&#160; In addition to these common indicators, there are several common schemes that you may want to be aware of.</p><p>One common scheme is the prize promotion scheme.&#160; Under this scheme, a phony telemarketer will call a person and tell them that they have won a prize, but that they must first make a purchase or payment before they can collect.&#160; Another common scheme is the fake charity.&#160; In this scheme, a scammer will call and ask for contribtions to a charitable organization that does not actually exist.&#160; To make matters worse, scammers often make up names that sound similar to real charitable organizations.&#160; Finally, another common scheme is the credit card repair offer.&#160; In this scheme, the caller will claim to be able to fix or erase negative information from your credit report.</p><p>If you or your loved ones have fallen victim to financial elder abuse, such as the telemarketing schemes mentioned above, CONTACT US at (213) 687-8080 or visit our website at <a href="http://www.burnsattorneys.com">www.burnsattorneys.com</a>. </p>'

aS"<p>In these difficult financial times, I am often asked what assets can a judgment creditor (&quot;<em>JC</em>&quot;)&#160;go after?&#160; This question obviously comes from a debtor that has resigned himself (itself,&#160;if a business entity)&#160;to the fact that he owes a&#160;creditor money, the creditor has sued him or is about to sue him, and there is little benefit to be gained by spending money defending the lawsuit.&#160; This requires an analysis of the laws in Texas exempting certain assets from execution (the process of collecting a judgment that is final).</p><p>Let's start with the easy part.&#160; Corporations and other entities have no exempt property. All of the assets of a business entity are subject to seizure.&#160; But remember, there is not a whole lot of benefit to a JC seizing assets of a business entity that are subject to a prior perfected security interest, and where there is little or no equity in the assets.&#160; If the JC seized those assets, payment would have to be made to the party holding the prior perfected security interest or that party will itself foreclose that security interest and take the asset from the JC.</p><p>With regard to an individual, the JC must determine if the judgment debtor's property is exempt from creditor's claims under one or more statutes.&#160; You can find a lot written on this topic.&#160; Let me try to summarize by stating simply that the following assets <u>cannot</u> be reached by the JC holding a final judgment against an individual:</p><ul><li>the home is exempt regardless of value (with some restrictions on acreage)</li><li>home furnishings, tools of the trade, clothing, vehicles and other specific personal property listed in the Texas exemption statutes are exempt, up to $30,000 for an individual and $60,000 for families</li><li>life insurance, retirement plans and wages are exempt, without any dollar limitation</li></ul><p>Knowing the property that is exempt from execution is important to know for anyone thinking about suing on a debt.&#160; Of course, there are reasons that you might want to sue on that debt in any event, and even knowing that it might not be immediately collectible.&#160; However, that is fodder for another blog at another time.</p><p>Nothing in this post should be considered legal advice by the reader. Let's face it,&#160;you don't know&#160;me and&#160;I don't know you.&#160; My aim is to provide the reader with some useful, but general, information about the topic.&#160; For a legal opinion that has teeth, consult your personal lawyer about your specific facts and circumstances.&#160; If you have no lawyer and like what you see here, then contact my law office to see if my services fit your needs.

aS'When an infant is being restricted of oxygen before or during birth, or what is known as birth asphyxiation, a condition named <a href="http://www.fagellaw.com/Information&#95;Center/Brain&#95;Cooling.aspx" title="hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy HIE">hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or HIE</a> may occur.&#160; HIE will continue to develop over the next several hours as the lack of proper oxygen and blood supply to the brain of the infant will cause additional events to occur within the brain as it attempts to repair itself.&#160; When HIE is mild, there shouldn&#8217;t be a major problem and the baby can be resuscitated.&#160; If the HIE is significant, the baby&#8217;s brain may cause even greater damage to itself as it tries to repair the problem. <br /><br />The good news is the baby usually has several hours before the brain damage becomes permanent.&#160; This gives doctors an opportunity to apply brain cooling to help give the baby a fighting chance for a normal life with little to no permanent brain damage.&#160; By placing the baby&#8217;s brain into a mild hypothermia, a brain cooling procedure can help reduce the infant&#8217;s temperature by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius for 72 hours after birth.&#160; This is done with a water cooled cap or a cool fluid filled blanket.&#160; Reducing the brain temperature of the baby helps slow down or stop dangerous chemical reactions that would cause additional brain injuries without the cooling.&#160; This appears to be the only medical treatment known to help a baby with HIE avoid serious and permanent brain injuries, including cerebral palsy in many cases assuming the following conditions are met:<br /><ul><li>Babies who have HIE must be given the brain cooling procedure within 6 hours of birth</li><li>Babies must have sustained brain damage</li><li>Babies must have been in gestation beyond 36 weeks</li></ul>Doctors need to be careful in making these determinations and take great care in applying brain cooling; otherwise they may cause additional brain damage.&#160; Once the baby&#8217;s temperature has been lowered to 33 degrees Celsius for 72 hours, the baby&#8217;s temperature can be slowly increased back to normal over the next 6 hours. &#160;<br /><br />For an informative video about the brain cooling procedure please visit <a href="http://www.fagellaw.com/Video&#95;Center/Types&#95;of&#95;Cases/Brain&#95;Cooling.aspx" title="brain cooling video">brain cooling video</a>. <br /><br />Visit us on Facebook and Twitter:<br /> Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/birthinjury" title="Facebook">https://www.facebook.com/birthinjury</a><br /> Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/fagellaw" title="Twitter">https://twitter.com/fagellaw</a><br /><br /><!--more-->Brain cooling allows newborn children with HIE resulting from birth hypoxia to avoid permanent or additional brain damage from occurring.&#160; This article discusses what the brain cooling procedure is and the conditions that must be met for the procedure to be successful.'

aS'Michigan personal injury attorney gives FAQs about the new anti-texting law<p><a href="http://www.michiganautolaw.com/auto-lawyers-blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/traffic-stop-texting-while-driving-ban.jpg"></a></p><p>I&#8217;ve received quite a few questions and e-mails about Michigan&#8217;s new texting while driving ban, and I know many of the other <a title="Personal injury attorneys" href="http://www.michiganautolaw.com/injuries/index.php" target="&#95;self">personal injury attorneys</a> here have as well.&#160; As you know, the law was signed by Gov. Granholm on the Oprah show and came into effect July 1, 2010.</p><p>What I&#8217;d like to do today is answer a number of the questions I&#8217;ve received on Michigan&#8217;s texting law. I do want to stress, as an attorney specializing in <a title="Michigan auto accident resource center" href="http://www.michiganautolaw.com/caraccidents/index.php" target="&#95;self">auto accidents</a>, that texting while driving can be deadly for yourself and for other Michigan families. In my other blogs on distracted driving and texting, I&#8217;ve discussed how texting behind the wheel is as dangerous as drinking and driving, so I won&#8217;t repeat them here. But remember, just by following the law, you can literally prevent car accidents and save lives.<br /><strong><br />q. What exactly does the texting while driving ban in Michigan prohibit?</strong><br />a. The law prohibits reading, typing or sending text messages using a wireless two-way communication device in a person&#8217;s hand or lap while driving a car.<br /><strong><br />q. What are the penalties for texting while driving?</strong><br />a. Under Michigan law, texting while driving will be classified as a primary offense, which means you can be pulled over and ticketed based on a text messaging offense alone. Violators will face a fine of $100 for the first offense and $200 for subsequent offenses.</p><p><strong>q. Does the ticket have points?</strong><br />a. The texting while driving ticket does not come with points, and will not become part of a driver&#8217;s permanent record.</p><p><strong>q. How will officers decipher whether a driver is texting or dialing?</strong><br />a. According to<a title="5 most dangerous intersections in Macomb County" href="http://www.michiganautolaw.com/auto-lawyers-blog/2008/12/02/watch-out-for-the-5-most-dangerous-intersections-in-macomb-county-michigan/" target="&#95;self"> Macomb County</a> Sheriff Mark Hackel, officers will have to make personal determinations whether a driver is texting or dialing. An officer can ask a driver for his or her phone, but the driver is not obliged to give it to an officer by law. Some officers have been told not to ticket people for texting at stop lights, as the law states a vehicle must be moving for the offense to occur.</p><p><strong>q. When can police pull over Michigan drivers?</strong><br />a. Police can pull over drivers if they see them texting at the wheel, even if there&#8217;s no other reason to flag them down.</p><p><strong>q. Can drivers still use dash-mounted GPS navigation systems?</strong><br />a. Yes.<br /><strong><br />q. Can a driver challenge a texting while driving ticket in court?</strong><br />a. Yes, just like any other ticket. But officers are being instructed to be prepared to explain their reasoning for ticketing to a judge, before making the decision to issue a ticket.</p><p><strong>q. Will this law save lives?</strong><br />a. As an auto accident attorney who has handled many preventable accidents due to distracted driving, I say yes. Texting while driving increases the likelihood of being involved in a car accident by more than 23 percent. That is, findings have shown that people who text while driving are&#160;23 percent more likely to be in a&#160;<a title="Texing while driving - 23 percent more likely to cause a crash" href="http://www.michiganautolaw.com/auto-lawyers-blog/2009/09/01/dont-text-and-drive-%E2%80%93/" target="&#95;self">car accident</a> than non-distracted drivers.</p><p>My hope is that Michigan&#8217;s new anti-texting law will help reduce this dangerous behavior and lead to safer roadways. Please, if only for avoiding a fine imposed by this new law, put the phone down while you&#8217;re behind the wheel and encourage others to do the same.

aS'<p>So what exactly does the <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/pages/3140/Auto-Accident-Lawyer-LA.htm">car accident attorney Los Angeles</a> do for injured victims? This is often a question that is asked after a person has been involved in a car collision and injured.

This will mean weeks or months of ongoing medical care, loss of work and in some cases the severe injuries will mean having a permanent disability.\r\n</p><p>These injuries can include traumatic head injuries, spinal cord and neck injuries, broken bones, internal injuries, cuts and gashes.

aS'<p class="MsoNormal">\r\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, impaired driving is often a symptom of a much larger problem &#8211; alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse can come in many forms. Some people drink excessively regularly (all day, every day), some people drink excessively on one occasion (binge drinking) and some individuals drink excessively over an extended period of time (&#8220;benders&#8221;). Binge drinking (consuming approximately four or more drinks in a two hour period of time) has become one of the most common forms of alcohol abuse in America. Although binge drinking is commonly associated with the younger generation, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 70 percent of binge drinking episodes involve adults age 26 or older. The CDC also reports that binge drinkers are 14 percent more likely to report alcohol-impaired driving than people who don&#8217;t binge drink. </p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bakersfield DUI Accident Statistics</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">Alcohol-related car accidents tragically kill thousands of Americans every year. In California, more than 1,145 people were tragically killed in alcohol-related car crashes in 2009, reports the California Highway Patrol (CHP). In Bakersfield, 12 people were killed and 163 were injured in alcohol-related car accidents in 2009. Keep in mind; an alcohol-related car crash is defined as an accident in which one driver involved had a blood alcohol concentration level of .01 or higher.

aS'<a href="mailto:oliviersciales@cs-avocats.lu"></a>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Four and a half years after Luxembourg introduced the law creating the Specialist Investment Fund regime for alternative vehicles, the grand duchy&#8217;s government has drafted legislation amending the SIF rules.<br /><br />The new legislation, which was placed before the Chamber of Deputies (Parliament) on August 12 and which is expected to become law before the end of this year, aims principally to adapt the SIF law to the requirements of the European Union&#8217;s Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers, which will take effect in July 2013, including rules on delegation, risk management and the handling of actual or potential conflicts of interest.<br /><br />In addition, in some instances the proposed changes will bring the SIF regime into line with Luxembourg&#8217;s funds legislation of December 17, 2010, which transposed into national law the Ucits IV Directive governing cross-border distribution of retail funds within the EU as well as introducing other changes affecting non-Ucits funds. For example, the law will enable sub-funds of a SIF umbrella structure to invest in other compartments of the same structure, as is already now the case for Ucits funds.<br /><br />Moving early to adopt requirements to be introduced by the AIFM Directive is in keeping with Luxembourg&#8217;s tradition, maintained over more than two decades, of putting EU legislation in place ahead of many competing European jurisdictions, enabling promoters to plan future fund launches with confidence about the stability of the country&#8217;s regulatory regime.<br /><br />The first of 18 articles of the draft&#160; legislation states that the activity of management of a SIF must comprise at a minimum management of the investment portfolio. This stipulation aims explicitly to exclude from the SIF regime passive funds that seek to create value solely by the long-term holding of assets and to create a distinction between SIFs and private wealth management companies governed by Luxembourg&#8217;s law of May 11, 2007. However, it does not exclude private equity or real estate funds from the SIF regime. Article 2 requires SIFs to have in place procedures to determine that its investors qualify as sophisticated rather than retail.<br /><br />Article 3 aligns the SIF rules with various features of the 2010 law. Where the fund&#8217;s articles of association are drawn up in English, the legislation no longer insists that these be translated into French or German. Funds no longer need to send shareholders physical copies of their annual reports unless this is specifically requested, and in addition, SIFs may establish a registration date five days preceding an annual general meeting of shareholders for the purposes of determining voting rights and what constitute a quorum.<br /><br />Article 5 of the draft law amends Article 42 of the 2007 SIF legislation, which allowed promoters of a fund to apply for authorisation by Luxembourg&#8217;s regulator, the Financial Sector Supervisory Authority (CSSF) up to one month following their launch. This provision, which in any case was not widely used by the promoters, is now abolished; once the law comes into force funds must have received approval from the CSSF before they can be launched, as is the case for funds created under the 2010 legislation.<br /><br />A new requirement makes authorisation subject to notification of the persons responsible for management of the SIF&#8217;s investment portfolio to the CSSF, which must henceforth ascertain that they are of good reputation and have the experience necessary to manage the type of alternative investment fund in question. Any changes in the identity of the fund&#8217;s portfolio managers must also be notified to the regulator.<br /><br />Under Article 6, SIFs must implement systems to monitor, measure and manage the investment risk of its individual positions and their contribution to the portfolio&#8217;s overall risk profile. They must also be structured and organised to minimise the risk of conflicts of interest, and draw up rules to manage such conflicts that do arise. The CSSF may draw up further regulations setting out detailed requirements on risk management and conflicts of interest.<br /><br />Article 7 defines the conditions under which SIFs may delegate various tasks and functions to third-party providers. Such delegation should not affect regulation of the fund; entities to which portfolio management is delegated must be approved for that function and subject to prudential regulation, unless the CSSF grant permission for delegation to individuals or entities to which this condition does not apply.<br /><br />A fund&#8217;s directors must be able to determine that the delegated provider is qualified and capable, and they must retain ultimate control over the fund&#8217;s activities. Delegation should not create conflicts of interest &#8211; so, for instance, investment management may not be delegated to the fund&#8217;s custodian &#8211; and the delegation of functions must be revealed in the fund&#8217;s offering documents.<br /><br />The CSSF&#8217;s powers of supervision and enquiry over funds set out in Article 8 aligns the provisions of the SIF legislation with those laid down by the Ucits IV directive, while Article 9 set out circumstances in which the CSSF or the Luxembourg prosecutors may apply to the courts for the dissolution and liquidation of one or more fund compartments. Article 10 deals with administrative fines, which the CSSF may publish unless this would seriously affect financial markets, damage the interests of investors or cause disproportionate prejudice to the parties affected.<br /><br />Under Article 12, the CSSF&#8217;s approval is now required for any substantial change made to the SIF&#8217;s offering documents, such as the name of the fund or of sub-funds, the replacement of the custodian, administrator, auditor or manager, the creation or new sub-funds or a significant change in investment policy.<br /><br />Article 13 authorises funds to deviate from their exclusive investment policy for the purposes of liquidity management, hedging or efficient portfolio management, while Article 14 bars SIFs in the form of companies that are in the course of being liquidated from issuing new shares, except where this is beneficial to the outcome of the liquidation itself. Article 15 allows the CSSF to withdraw authorisation for one or more sub-funds of a SIF while maintaining the authorisation for other sub-funds of the same structure.<br /><br />The draft law follows the 2010 legislation in allowing one sub-fund of a SIF to invest in another, although not all provisions are identical. This clarifies that the rules set out in Luxembourg&#8217;s 1915 company law regarding a company&#8217;s investment in its own shares do not apply to SIFs. Sub-funds of the same SIF may not cross-invest in each other, and voting rights of shares held by one sub-fund in another are suspended.<br /><br />Finally, Article 17 stipulates that SIFs established before the date of entry into force of the revision law will have a transitional period up to June 30, 2012 before they are obliged to comply with its requirements on ascertaining that their investors are sophisticated (Article 2, paragraph 3) and risk management and conflicts of interest (Article 42bis) and up to June 30, 2013 to comply with the new rules on the delegation of functions (Article 42ter).<br /><br />You may find more information on our AIFM blog at www.cs-avocats.lu/aifm-directive</p><p class="MsoNormal">For any query, please contact: </p><p class="MsoNormal">Olivier Sciales<br />Partner<br />Chevalier &amp; Sciales <br />51, Route de Thionville<br />L-2611 Luxembourg<br />Tel: + 352 26 25 90 30<br />Fax: +352 26 25 83 88<br />Email: oliviersciales@cs-avocats.lu</p><p class="MsoNormal">Olivier Sciales is a partner in the Luxembourg law firm Chevalier &amp; Sciales<br /><br /></p>'

aS"<p>The Suffolk County Legislature has taken steps over the past year&#160;to create&#160;a Suffolk County Traffic Violations Bureau that will&#160;replace the Traffic Violations Bureau operated by the NYS Department of Motor Vehicles and located in Hauppauge. The NYSDMV Traffic Violations Bureau&#160;presently prosecutes non-criminal traffic violations issued in the towns of Babylon, Brookhaven, Huntington, Islip and Smithtown. By establishing the County's own Traffic Violations Bureau, the Suffolk County Legislature hopes to maintain greater control over the processing and prosecution of traffic violations, to decrease police overtime costs in attending hearings and to increase revenue for the County.&#160;On August 17, 2012, Governor Cuomo signed legislation which allows Suffolk County to establish a County-run Traffics Violation Bureau.</p><p>The establishment of a Suffolk County Traffic Violations Bureau is potentially very advantageous to the County and its residents from a fiscal standpoint&#160;because Suffolk County will be able to retain a large part of the funds generated from the tickets issued in the above mentioned towns. It is uncertain at the moment what the ramifications will be for drivers&#160;as a result of the establishment of the&#160;Suffolk County Traffic Violations Bureau but it is hoped that&#160;the prosecutors of the County-run Bureau will be able to engage in plea bargaining&#160;that will offer the possibility of point reductions on moving violations. A plea negotiation is not offered at the present time on tickets in the NYSDMV Traffic Violations Bureau and drivers are customarily faced with&#160;having to go to a hearing&#160;if they wish to challenge a ticket. If the police officer appears for the hearing, the officer's testimony is usually very persuasive to the hearing officer.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>Unfortunately, the implementation of the County-run Traffic Violations Bureau, which is scheduled to open April 1, 2013,&#160;is hitting some speed bumps.&#160;As recently reported by Newsday, the Suffolk County Legislature last week did not go forward with an emergency resolution to approve start-up funds for the County-run Traffic Violations Bureau because of concerns on the part of some legislators related to the hiring plans for the Bureau and the location and design plans for the Bureau's office and operating space. It is anticipated that more specific plans for hiring, location and design&#160;will be submitted to the Legislature before the end of October. Let's hope that the plans for&#160;the Suffolk County Traffic Violations Bureau can get on track and make fast progress toward the opening date of April 1, 2013. Suffolk County, its residents and drivers have much to gain from a locally operated Traffic Violations Bureau.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>"

aS'Being in a car accident can be a truly devastating experience,  regardless of how serious your crash may have been.\r\n<p>And when it comes to  accident injuries, among the most common are related to the neck and  back. After all, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiplash&#95;%28medicine%29" target="&#95;blank">whiplash</a>\r\n is a condition that many accident victims  suffer and is typically \r\ncaused upon striking another vehicle or  stationary object at any speed;\r\n this collision causes the vehicle to  stop abruptly, forcing the driver\r\n and other passengers to lunge forward  due to the velocity. For those \r\nwho are wearing seat belts, and back and  neck can be seriously injured.\r\n Of course, whiplash from a seat belt is  better than the alternative, \r\nbut it can still be quite painful.</p>\r\n<p>So if you have suffered a <a href="http://www.getmejustice.com/">neck injury following a car crash</a>,\r\n regardless  of whether the symptoms of the whiplash surfaced hours or \r\neven days  after the accident, the fact remains that you should seek \r\nmedical  attention immediately. After all, the pain can get worse over \r\ntime and,  if untreated, you may have an underlying injury that could \r\nseriously  impede your everyday life. Of course, seeking medical \r\nattention for such  injuries can be expensive, especially with the high \r\ncost of hospital  visits these days. This is especially true if you do \r\nnot have adequate  insurance coverage.</p>\r\n<p>In these situations, the best thing that you can do is to file an  \r\ninsurance claim. This way, you can reach a settlement with your  \r\ninsurance company to cover the costs of your medical bills, vehicle  \r\ndamage, and other related expenses from your crash. Of course, you  \r\nshould not expect to receive a fair settlement on your first attempt at \r\n filing a claim, as many insurance companies these days will shell out \r\nas  little money as possible. Instead, you should take the matter to \r\ncourt  if your original settlement is unfair and your insurance company \r\nis  unwilling to work with you.</p>\r\n<p>When going to court, you should also take the time to hire a neck \r\ninjury  attorney. This way, you will have a professional on your side \r\nwho has  experience with cases like yours and will give you the best \r\nchance for  success.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href="http://www.getmejustice.com/injury-lawyers">Personal injury attorneys</a>\r\n of Shapiro Goldman Babboni &amp; Walsh have represented people who have\r\n  been injured by another\'s negligence and those who\'s insurance \r\ncompanies  are attempting to get out of providing fair compensation for \r\nserious  injuries.

aS"<p>&#160; &#160;&#160; Your Federal disability retirement application was well-prepared:&#160; perhaps it was prepared with the help of an attorney; the medical documentation seemed solidly unequivocal; the doctor made the necessary connections between one's medical conditions and the type of essential elements of one's job; the packet, by all accounts, should have been approved, and by all expectations, the approval should have been reasonably expected.&#160; Instead, you receive a letter stating that your disability retirement application was disapproved, and a &quot;Discussion&quot; section follows, explaining why the Office of Personnel Management denied your application.&#160; Why did this happen?&#160; There are multiple reasons why such a denial can occur:&#160; the OPM specialist could be a person who lacks a clear understanding of the applicable laws governing disability retirement applications (more often than not, this is the case, and what you actually get in the so-called &quot;Discussion&quot; Section of the denial letter is merely a regurgitation of the statutory criteria for eligibility for disability retirement, without a recognition of the interpretation of such criteria by Federal Judges for the Federal Court of Appeals or by Administrative Judges from the Merit Systems Protection Board); it could be as simple as the OPM representative selectively choosing to read the medical reports and records, and disregarding or ignoring supportive portions of the medical records and reports; or it could be that additional medical reports and records need to be obtained in order to &quot;shore up&quot; the application.&#160; In any event, whatever the reason for the denial, one should not panic.&#160; It is merely one step in a long, administrative process.&#160; The mere fact that OPM denies your disability retirement application does not mean that they are &quot;right&quot; in doing so; indeed, in my opinion, they are rarely right.&#160; That is why one has the right to have it &quot;reconsidered&quot;, and the opportunity to make further legal arguments, and obtain further medical documentation in support of your claim.&#160; And, beyond that, you have the right to file an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board -- and beyond.&#160; Never give up; always take it to the next step.&#160; In most cases, it will prove that OPM was in error, and in fighting the denial, you will have secured some semblence of financial security for your future.</p><p>Sincerely, Robert R.

aS'I\'ve known for a long time about the lengths insurance companies will go to avoid paying a claim. I&#8217;ve seen a lot in my years as a <a href="http://www.dlslawfirm.com/attorney-profiles/dianne-sawaya" title="Experienced Denver personal injury attorney">personal injury lawyer</a>, but the other day a client told me about an incident that still surprised me.<br /><br />This client had been in involved in a bad <a href="http://www.dlslawfirm.com/auto-accident-injury/car-accident-lawyer-denver" title="Denver car accident attorney">car accident</a>, and it turns out the other driver was uninsured. My client was hurt pretty badly, the stack of medical bills was piling up and she was facing a lengthy recovery and rehabilitation.<br /><br />At least one thing was in her favor: Her insurance policy had good uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. At least she thought it was good, until she tried to use it.<br /><br />First came the call from the insurance company, which tried to convince her that her injuries weren&#8217;t really all that serious. To avoid all that hassle and paperwork why don&#8217;t we just settle things now, and here&#8217;s a check, they said.<br /><br />My client didn\'t fall for it. A little while later, my client got another call. This time is was her insurance agent on the line. He was just calling to check up on how she&#8217;s doing, and was everything being taken care of by the insurance company, and by the way, maybe you should think about taking a check to make all this go away.<br /><br />Okay, that one takes the cake. It&#8217;s probably not unusual for an insurance company to try to get out of paying a lot of big bills. After all, paying claims really cuts into the profit margin. But I don\'t think many people would expect insurers to put their own agents up to doing the insurance company&#8217;s bidding, cutting away at the trust between the agent and their client.<br /><br />Here are three important things to note from this experience:<br /><br />First, always have uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage on your policy. Yes, it costs a little more. But remember that a third of the drivers on Colorado\'s roads are uninsured. Can you afford to be without it?<br /><br />Second, insurance companies are not your friend &#8211; even when it&#8217;s your own insurer. Think otherwise at your own peril.<br /><br />And finally, if you&#8217;ve been injured in a car accident, you do need a personal injury lawyer. I can guarantee you that no insurance company would try a stunt like that with me &#8211; they know exactly how far they&#8217;d get.<br /><br />To learn more about insurance company tricks, give me a call at (303) 758-4777, email me at <a href="dls@dlslawfirm.com" title="Dianne Sawaya"></a>DLS@dlslawfirm.com or visit us on the Web at <a href="http://www.dlslawfirm.com" title="Colorado personal injury lawyer">www.dlslawfirm.com</a>.<!--more-->I\'ve known for a long time about the lengths insurance companies will go to avoid paying a claim.

aS'<p>How not to recover fair compensation after a San Diego motorcycle accident is by not having an experienced motorcycle accident attorney representing your rights to compensation. The injured victim of a motorcycle accident that does not have legal representation of the attorney that specializes in motorcycle accidents and attempts to hold the driver accountable will find they are in over their head. Part of holding a negligent driver accountable is holding their insurance company responsible and insurance companies do not want to pay compensation. </p><p>Their agents will go to great lengths to keep from having to award compensation, they will begin with trying to place blame on the rider, who is injured, trying to heal and under financial stress. The insurance company counts on the injured victim being under financial stress, which means they can offer a low amount of compensation. They bank on the fact that the injured victim needs the money and will take their offer and then they have them sign papers stating they cannot fight for more compensation on this accident. ?\r\n</p><p>This is the way how not to recover fair compensation after a San Diego motorcycle accident and it is proven in studies that have been done comparing the injured victim that goes through the compensation process alone, against the victim that has the representation of a motorcycle accident attorney. The injured rider that has the legal representation of a motorcycle accident attorney does not have the stress of dealing with the insurance company; they do not receive a low settlement and do not need to worry about filing all the lawsuit paperwork properly. </p><p>When the injured motorcycle rider is represented by an experienced <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/">motorcycle accident attorney</a>, they get the benefit of an attorney that specializes in motorcycle accidents, they know the laws that protect the injured victims rights, they have the resources to recreate the collision, they have access to experts and they have experience in dealing with the insurance company and their lawyers. This means that it can be a non-stressful legal process for the injured biker and their family, to recover fair compensation for their injuries and the damages to the bike.  </p><p>The difference between having a motorcycle accident attorney representing the injured biker and standing up against the insurance company alone is a difference not just in the amount of compensation recovered, but also in the amount of stress the injured victim will suffer.

aS'<p MARGIN: 3pt 0in"><u>MBNA America Bank, N.A. v. Garcia</u>, --- P.3d ----, 2009 WL 839352 (Or.App. Apr 01, 2009) (NO. 050505309, A134952)</p><p MARGIN: 3pt 0in">Without defendant&#8217;s knowledge, defendant\'s former wife obtained credit cards from plaintiff in defendant&#8217;s name. She then incurred substantial debt. Plaintiff submitted the matter to arbitration as provided in the credit card contract. On the recommendation of his former wife, defendant retained a man who falsely represented that he was an attorney and who, in the arbitration and in several federal court cases, raised a number of obviously bogus claims and defenses, the result of which was an arbitration award against defendant, duly confirmed by a judgment in circuit court. Defendant retained a licensed attorney who convinced the trial court to vacate the judgment. The plaintiff appealed. &#160;</p><p MARGIN: 3pt 0in"><b>Facts of the Case</b></p><p MARGIN: 3pt 0in">Plaintiff sent a credit card application form addressed to defendant at his home address. His former wife intercepted the application and filled it out in defendant\'s name, providing an address that was either a post office box or the residence of a friend, neither of which defendant knew about. She then used the cards and accumulated substantial debt, which defendant did not discover until plaintiff began collection proceedings. Defendant agreed on a payment plan. Four years later, defendant defaulted on making payments on the account, and plaintiff, pursuant to the credit card agreement, initiated arbitration proceedings in the National Arbitration Forum (NAF).</p><p MARGIN: 3pt 0in">Acting on a recommendation from his former wife, defendant &#8220;retained&#8221; a man named Barlow to represent him, believing Barlow to be a licensed attorney. Barlow was not licensed to practice law. Apparently, he advised defendant that defendant could favorably resolve the collection matter by demanding that plaintiff submit the claim to an arbitrator, Alta Arbitration Associates, working out of Billings, Montana, which would invoke certain obscure legal theories to invalidate the debt. Defendant followed that advice. Alta Arbitration Associates, which apparently relied on theories it obtained on the Internet, was not one of the fora approved in the agreement between the parties. Plaintiff refused to participate. Alta Arbitration Associates then rendered a &#8220;judgment&#8221; in defendant\'s favor and bestowed on him an &#8220;award&#8221; of $62,765.46 plus interest and costs. When defendant, still &#8220;represented&#8221; by Barlow, attempted to enforce the &#8220;judgment&#8221; from Alta Arbitration Associates in federal court, the court twice dismissed the complaint.</p><p MARGIN: 3pt 0in">In the meantime, plaintiff and defendant participated in arbitration proceedings before the NAF, resulting in an arbitration award in favor of plaintiff and against defendant for $23,515.33. Plaintiff filed a motion to confirm the award in Multnomah County Circuit Court, defendant failed to appear at the hearing, and, on February 18, 2005, the trial court issued a default judgment confirming the award and awarding plaintiff a money judgment.</p><p MARGIN: 3pt 0in">In May 2006, defendant contacted the Oregon State Bar in regard to his pending dissolution of marriage case, and the Bar referred him to a licensed attorney. At that point, defendant learned that Barlow was not licensed to practice law. Meanwhile, plaintiff sought to enforce the judgment against defendant through garnishment proceedings. Defendant filed a motion for relief from judgment under ORCP 71 C (court\'s inherent power to set aside a judgment). On February 5, 2007, the court granted defendant\'s motion. </p><p MARGIN: 3pt 0in"><b>Intrinsic v Extrinsic Fraud</b></p><p MARGIN: 3pt 0in">A court may grant relief under ORCP 71 C based on extrinsic fraud, but will deny it if the fraud is intrinsic. Wimber v. Timpe, 109 Or.App. 139, 146, 818 P.2d 954 (1991). Extrinsic fraud consists of acts not involved in the factfinder\'s consideration of the merits of the case; it provides a basis for relief from a judgment because it prevents the unsuccessful party from fully trying the case. Examples of extrinsic fraud include keeping a party in ignorance of an action, false offers of compromise, an attorney\'s betrayal of the client\'s interest to an adversary and other acts of a similar nature. Intrinsic fraud, in contrast, consists of acts involved in the merits of the case, typically perjured testimony. If the fraud is intrinsic, the litigant had an opportunity to refute the representations, and a court will deny relief because of the strong policy favoring finality in litigation. </p><p MARGIN: 3pt 0in">The court held the fraud perpetrated by defendant\'s former wife was intrinsic, because whether she fraudulently opened a credit card account in defendant\'s name goes to the merits of the case-that is, to whether defendant is liable for the debt incurred and is bound by the agreement to arbitrate. However, the fraud perpetrated by Barlow was extrinsic. It did not involve a fraudulent representation as to any matter that was at issue in the case; rather, it was a fraudulent representation that prevented defendant from having a genuine attorney present his case, and was therefore &#8220;of a similar nature&#8221; to &#8220;an attorney\'s betrayal of the client\'s interest to an adversary.&#8221; </p><p MARGIN: 3pt 0in">ORCP 71 B(1)(c) does not limit to the court to only &#160;vacate a judgment on account of intrinsic fraud of an &#8220;adverse party.&#8221; </p><p MARGIN: 3pt 0in">The trial court remanded the case to the arbitrator. The Court of Appeals interpreted the mandate to mean that, if plaintiff chooses to pursue the case, it can return to arbitration, where the arbitrator will decide as a threshold question whether the credit card agreement that contains the arbitration provision is enforceable. </p>'

These claims against vaccine manufacturers cannot normally be filed in state or federal civil courts, but instead must be heard in the Court of Claims, sitting without a jury. The program was established by the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), passed by the United States Congress in response to a threat to the vaccine supply due to a 1980s scare over the DPT vaccine. Despite the belief of most public health officials that claims of side effects were unfounded, large jury awards had been given to some plaintiffs, most DPT vaccine makers had ceased production, and officials feared the loss of herd immunity.[1]</p><p class="MsoNormal" /><p /><p class="MsoNormal">Some parents of children with autism spectrum disorders have attributed the disorders\' onset to vaccines, often citing the mercury-based preservative thiomersal as the cause, and have demanded compensation from vaccine makers.

aS'<p>The judicial system is essentially divided into two types of cases: civil and criminal. Thus, a study of Civil Procedure is basically a study of the procedures that apply in cases that are not criminal.</p>\r\n<p>Generally, criminal trials are used by the government to protect and provide relief to the general public by attempting to punish an individual. Civil trials can be used by anyone to enforce, redress, or protect their legal rights through court orders and monetary awards. The two types of trials are very different in character and thus have separate procedural rules and practices.</p>\r\n<p>Procedural law is distinguished from Substantive Law, which creates, defines, and regulates the rights and duties of individuals. Federal and state constitutions, statutes, and judicial decisions form the basis for substantive Civil Law on matters such as contracts, torts,and probate. Procedural law prescribes the methods by which individuals may enforce substantive laws. The basic concern of procedural law is the fair, orderly, efficient, and predictable application of substantive laws. Procedural guidance can be found in court rules, in statutes, and in judicial decisions.</p>'

aS'<p>Torrance, California, is located in densely populated Southern California, an area notorious for traffic with its share of accidents.  Rear-end collisions are common, resulting in many injuries including &#8220;whiplash&#8221;.  Whiplash results when the head and neck are whipped harshly forward and backward.  The resulting extreme motion can cause strains and tears in the ligaments and muscles of the neck, as well as stretching and strain to the spinal cord.  </p><p>Of course, spinal cord health is vital to the body it is the highway along which communication travels between the brain and the body.  And your <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/" title="personal injury attorney">personal injury attorney</a> knows that musculoskeletal injuries are no less traumatic and can be quite painful and difficult to resolve.\r\nThe most important factor to healing whiplash is immediate treatment.  Evaluating the severity of whiplash and beginning treatment within mere hours of the accident is necessary in putting a halt to inflammation and other processes that will further damage the neck and spine area.  </p><p>Unfortunately, most people falsely believe that an ambulance staff is equipped to make decisions about spine and neck health; they are not.  Even some emergency rooms may be understaffed.  Proper evaluation and treatment really should begin as soon as possible with permanent staff or a specialist.  Unfortunately, most people believe that the seemingly minor aches and pains they feel after an accident indicate only minor injuries. </p><p> Just as the ambulance staff is intended to transport patients to a true medical facility, the victim should not try to guess what type of injuries he or she has rather than let a doctor decide.  This type of mistake can have life-long consequences as whiplash that is untreated or left too long can result in a long-term set of symptoms classified as &#8220;whiplash associated disorder&#8221;. </p><p> These symptoms can include depression, limited range of motion, and even effects on workplace and home life.  Add that to the usual symptoms of whiplash which can include headaches, dizziness, shoulder and arm pain, and insomnia.  Even waiting for insurance to make medical arrangements can be a waste of precious time that would best be spent evaluating and treating.\r\n</p><p>If you or your loved one is the victim of an automobile collision due to the negligence of another driver, it is important that you call an attorney convenient to your Torrance location immediately after the accident.

aS'In my early March, 2010, blog I dealt briefly with the complex legal issues that can arise with assisted reproductive technology, commonly called, &#8220;artificial insemination.&#8221; The recent case of <em>Wells v. Wells</em>, No. 2001-CA-01813-COA (Decided June 1, 2010), brings some of theses issues to life. Reyna was a nurse and Forrest was a plastic surgeon. During their marriage, they utilized artificial insemination to parent twins. After the birth, Reina stopped working. Later, unbeknownst to Forrest, Reina had herself artificially inseminated with a donor sperm resulting in the birth of a third child. Reina deceived Forrest into believing this was his child until she was about 8 months pregnant. Forrest could not abide by Reina&#8217;s deceit and separated. Later, Reina developed a relationship and Forrest sued for adultery. The trial court awarded custody of the twins to Forrest. He found the parties equally suited for custody in every way except moral turpitude which he found favored Forrest. The trial court found that intentionally deceiving Forest about her pregnancy brought &#8220;her moral fitness into question.&#8221;<br /><br />The trial court also considered her adultery and found that she exercised poor parental judgment in allowing her boyfriend in the home overnight with the children there (at the time the children were 3). Once again, a woman loses custody of her child because she allows a man to stay overnight in her home with the children present.'

aS'<p>In Georgia, and in most states, the &#8220;legal limit&#8221; for a driver&#8217;s blood or breath alcohol concentration (over the age of 21) is 0.08.&#160; Blood/Breath Alcohol Concentration (BAC) is the amount of alcohol in an individual&#8217;s bloodstream or breath.&#160; BAC is expressed as the amount of ethanol, measured in grams, in 100 milliliters of blood or 210 liters of breath.&#160;&#160; In order to get a BAC from an individual&#8217;s breath, law enforcement agencies throughout Georgia use a machine called the Intoxilyzer 5000 which is manufactured by a company named CMI, Inc. <a href="http://www.alcoholtest.com">www.alcoholtest.com</a>. This machine is designed to detect the amount of alcohol present in a person&#8217;s breath and convert this reading into a numerical alcohol concentration.&#160; The machine operator is required to obtain two separate breath samples from the individual.&#160; According to Georgia law, &#8220;&#8230;the readings shall not differ from each other by an alcohol concentration of greater than 0.020 grams and the lower of the two results shall be determinative&#8230;&#8221; (O.C.G.A. &#167;40-6-392). Therefore, the police officer is only allowed to use the lower of the two readings. </p><p>The Intoxilyzer 5000 works by measuring a sample of breath that is passed through a chamber.&#160; A beam of infrared light is projected from one end of the chamber to the other.&#160; The breath chamber has a filter wheel that spins and is designed to filter out potential contaminants or molecules that can give false readings. If there is any alcohol present in the &#8220;deep lung&#8221; sample of breath, some of the light energy will be absorbed by the alcohol molecules.&#160; The Intoxilyzer 5000 is designed to measure the amount of light energy absorbed by the alcohol molecules and convert this into a numerical BAC reading.</p><p>The Georgia Bureau of Investigations (GBI) Division of Forensic Sciences (<a href="http://www.gbi.georgia.gov">www.gbi.georgia.gov</a>) is the agency in charge of selecting and supervising the breath testing procedures throughout the state.&#160; Even though more sophisticated and accurate breath testing machines are available, the GBI has chosen to continue to use the Intoxilyzer 5000.&#160; Unfortunately for Georgia drivers suspected of DUI, the GBI only calibrates these machines once a quarter instead of calibrating the machine before each test as many states require.&#160; Additionally, the GBI has decided to use an Intoxilyzer 5000 model that does not have all of the safeguards that are available for the machine.&#160; For example, the Georgia version of the Intoxilyzer 5000 does not have the optional equipment that allows a breath sample to be preserved for independent testing.&#160; Also, the GBI does not maintain thorough and accurate records of the data the machine generates which greatly diminishes the ability to challenge the accuracy of the machine.</p><p>Please call the <a href="http://www.cobbcountyattorneys.com">Marietta DUI Attorneys</a> at Gentry, Smith, Dettmering, Morgan &amp; Schnatmeier, LLP at 770-771-5097 to discuss the breath test results in your case.&#160; </p><!--more--><p><a href="http://www.cobbcountyattorneys.com">Marietta DUI Lawyer</a> Robert F.

aS'<p>We handle all types of employment claims &#8211; but we rarely see a good &#8216;wrongful termination&#8217; claim.&#160; That&#8217;s not because there aren&#8217;t a good number of terminations that are wrong, or unfair, but because <a href="http://www.ezoldlaw.com/">Pennsylvania wrongful termination laws</a> are very limited.&#160; These laws apply to the entire Commonwealth; for instance, although Philadelphia has some local ordinances that protect employees under limited circumstances, but do not protect employees against wrongful terminations.</p><p>The reality of employment is that it is often unfair; terminations for no reason or because your boss doesn&#8217;t like you, discipline that is unevenly handed out, favoritism, nepotism, and fear-based management styles are all examples.&#160; Just because an action is unfair does not make it illegal, however.&#160; Pennsylvania (like most states) follows the &#8216;employment at will&#8217; doctrine.&#160; In other words, an employer can fire or discipline an employee in Pennsylvania for any reason, for a bad or ridiculous reason, for an unfair reason or for no reason at all.&#160; &#8216;At will&#8217; employment can benefit employees who want to leave; an employee can quit at any time, without notice and without any good reason, and go immediately to work elsewhere (even for a competitor, assuming there is no noncompetition agreement or trade secret issue).</p><p>The &#8216;at will&#8217; doctrine is very strong in Pennsylvania; for instance, it generally allows an employer to ignore the terms of their own handbook in setting wages, employee responsibilities, discipline and termination procedures.&#160; An employer&#8217;s handbook is not a contract; they can change the conditions of your employment at will and without notice, regardless of what the handbook says.&#160; For instance, you can work for a manufacturing company in Philadelphia with a thorough book of employment policies, including their own written &#8216;three strikes&#8217; policy before termination, and yet be fired on the spot without warning &#8211; for something that the employer admits is not your fault.&#160;&#160; In fact, Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held that Pennsylvania law &#8220;does not prohibit firing an employee for relying on an employer&#8217;s promise.&#8221;</p><p>This seems very unfair to most people.&#160; Every kid on the playground knows that if you set a rule, it is unfair if you don&#8217;t follow it yourself &#8211; and yet, in the real world (at least in Pennsylvania), there are generally no consequences when an employer ignores their own rules.</p><p>There is a limit to this unfairness, however.&#160; First, the terms of an employment contract can limit an employer&#8217;s &#8216;at will&#8217; rights.&#160; For instance, if you negotiate a contract that states you cannot be fired without cause, the &#8216;at will&#8217; standard no longer applies.&#160; Second, &#8216;at will&#8217; employment does not mean that an employer can break other laws; for instance, <a href="http://www.ezoldlaw.com/attorneys/chris/">no employer may discriminate</a> against, sexually harass or deny vested benefits to an employee (this is where some of Philadelphia&#8217;s extra protections come into play).&#160; Finally, the &#8216;at will&#8217; standard can be overridden by a Pennsylvania court&#8217;s view of public policy.</p><p>&#8216;Public policy&#8217; is truly where &#8216;unfair&#8217; becomes &#8216;wrongful termination.&#8217;&#160; In essence, there are some very limited circumstances that are so fundamentally unfair as to give rise to a claim for wrongful termination in Pennsylvania &#8211; regardless of the &#8216;at will&#8217; doctrine.&#160; Pennsylvania courts don&#8217;t necessarily use the term &#8216;unfair,&#8217; however &#8211; instead they will allow a claim for wrongful termination if it violates &#8216;public policy.&#8217;</p><p>What is public policy?&#160; What do Pennsylvania courts find so objectionable, so unfair, as to override the at-will doctrine?&#160;&#160; This area of the law is still developing, but there are some clear examples set by the courts.&#160; These examples can be categorized as follows (these categories are of my own creation and are not set forth explicitly in case law; they are a tool to assist in general understanding of the law):</p><p>Civic Duties:&#160; Pennsylvania citizens have obligations to the public, such as the obligation not to commit a crime, to serve as a juror when called, etc.&#160; Pennsylvania courts have seen these duties as a strong public policy.&#160; Therefore, if you are terminated for refusing to commit a crime, refusing to commit perjury, serving jury duty, or for reporting a health or safety hazard that you are obligated by statute to report, then you can sue for wrongful termination.&#160; </p><p>Personal Rights:&#160; This is a tricky area; there are few &#8216;personal rights&#8217; that can affect an at-will&#8217; relationship.&#160; However, some personal rights which are set forth in a statute &#8211; a written law &#8211; can be the basis for &#8216;public policy&#8217;.&#160; For instance, Pennsylvania law states that an employer may not require an employee to take a lie detector test to maintain employment or become employed.&#160; Pennsylvania courts have held that terminating an employee for refusing a lie detector test is a violation of public policy, and gives rise to a wrongful termination claim.&#160; Similarly, terminating an employee for not disclosing a pardoned conviction is a violation of public policy.&#160; I believe that Pennsylvania courts will eventually reach the conclusion that certain areas of an employee&#8217;s private life (who you vote for, what is in your private communications, certain medical information) are also protected &#8211; but this has not yet happened.</p><p>Employment Compacts:&#160; Pennsylvania employees enjoy access to unemployment compensation and workman&#8217;s compensation programs.&#160; The courts feel that these programs represent a compact between employers and workers.&#160; For instance, a worker is generally not allowed to sue their employer for injuries on the job, and in exchange, they receive workman&#8217;s compensation.&#160; Pennsylvania courts believe that allowing employers to terminate employees for using these systems undermines the systems and robs the employees of their end of the compact.&#160; Therefore, if you are terminated for applying for unemployment (generally in the past), or for applying for workmen&#8217;s compensation, you can sue for wrongful termination.&#160; Furthermore, if you are terminated for filing a claim under Pennsylvania&#8217;s Wage Payment and Collection Law, you can sue for wrongful termination (although there is a split in the law which may allow an employer to terminate you for demanding wages due, but before you sue &#8211; seems silly, but true).</p><p>It must be stressed that public policy is not &#8216;what the courts think is good for the public,&#8217; but what the courts believe is the public policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.&#160; The courts will look to Pennsylvania statutory law, regulations and constitution to determine what is &#8216;public policy.&#8217;&#160; The courts also need to find that the public policy mandate is &#8216;clear.&#8217;</p><p>What is the reality for the average employee in Pennsylvania?&#160; It means that your employer generally does not have to treat you fairly.&#160; Is that bad management?&#160; It certainly is.&#160; Is that right?&#160; It certainly isn&#8217;t.&#160; Is that illegal?&#160; Probably not.&#160; The reality is that the best safeguard you have is not the law, but making sure that you have other jobs to go to.&#160; Never tie yourself to an employer so completely that you don&#8217;t know what else is out there, and don&#8217;t have the skills to work anywhere else.&#160; That way, when your employer is unfair, you can find an employer who has more appreciation for you and its other employees.</p><p>HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?</p><p>I&#8217;m writing this blog because I have a passion for the work I do.&#160;

aS'\r\n<p>Auto companies are coming under increasing fire from federal safety officials who believe these companies are doing little to minimize the risks of distracted driving. Ford Motor Company is now touting the results of a study it conducted in collaboration with the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, which shows that the use of its Sync voice activated system minimizes the risk of distractions, and consequently, the risk of accidents.</p><p>The study compared 21 drivers aged between 19 and 51. The drivers drove a Ford Mercury Marina while initiating a phone call, changing music tracks and having a conversation using Sync.&#160; The same motorists were then made to perform the same activities - dialing a number, changing music tracks and talking on the phone manually using a cell phone. The study showed that motorists who used Ford\'s Sync system were able to complete the tasks much quicker. Most importantly, these motorists were able to perform these tasks without having to take their eyes off the road for too long. In contrast, the motorists who were performing these tasks with their hands, took their eyes off the road and hands off the steering wheel for longer periods of time.</p><p>When the motorists used a cell phone to dial a phone number, they took about four times longer than with Sync. When it came to changing music tracks, the motorists took up to 10 times longer to change tracks than when they used Sync.</p><p>Ford is obviously very pleased that its Sync voice activation system has been found to work much better at preventing driving distractions than the use of hand held cell phones. However, the company is going to have to do much more to please federal safety officials. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood in particular has been very disapproving of voice activation systems like Ford\'s Sync. Secretary LaHood and <a href="http://aogllp.com/personal-injury-attorney-los-angeles" title="Los Angeles Personal Injury Lawyers">California personal injury lawyers</a> firmly believe that any kind of distraction while driving is far too much.

aS'<p MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Beginning on July 1, 2010, driving under the influence (DUI) laws are changing as it relates to driver&#8217;s licenses. While Ignition Interlock Devices (IID) are going to become more prevelent, mulitiple offenders will be back on the roads sooner. But what is an IID? IID is a device that is installed in a DUI offender&#8217;s vehicle. The installation, and every 60 days of calibration, is completed by a certified installer. This, of course, is paid for by the DUI offender. The person must blow into the device before the car will start and then periodically while driving, the person must again blow. If the device detects any alcohol, the car will not function. If we really wanted to prevent driving under the influence from occuring at all wouldn&#8217;t we want all vehicles to be manufactured with these devices? Where&#8217;s the business in that&#8230;.</p><p MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">The first-time offender who lives in Orange County will not suffer any changes in their driving prileges, but if they live in Los Angeles they will. A first-time offender who lives in Orange County may suffer a 30-day suspension period, however, after 30 days they will be eligible for their driver&#8217;s license if they are enrolled in a DUI class, have an SR22 insurance form, and pay a reinstatement fee. However, if this same person was a resident of Los Angeles, Alameda, Sacramento or Tulare Counties, they would also have to install an IID in order to obtain their restricted driver&#8217;s license. This is a pilot program. Fair? No, but a good reason to stay in the OC.</p><p MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">For the second and third-time DUI offenders, the consequences are the same throughout California. A second-time DUI offender prior to July 1, 2010, would serve a complete one-year driver&#8217;s license suspension. As of July 1, 2010, as long as the offender is enrolled in the DUI class, has proof of an SR22 insurance form, pays the required fee and installs the IID, the person may obtain a restricted driver&#8217;s license after serving a 90-day suspension period. A restricted driver&#8217;s license gives the person the ability to drive to, from and during work, and to and from the DUI classes.</p><p MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">The third-time offender, prior to July 1, 2010, would have their driver&#8217;s license revoked for 3 years, and become eligible for a restriced driver&#8217;s license only after completing the 18-month DUI program. However, under the new laws, this offender will be eligible for a restricted driver&#8217;s license after serving a 6-month suspension.</p><p MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">This change in the law is a windfall to the second and third time DUI offenders along with the IID providers. Hopefully, it will also keep us safe. </p><p MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">visit: <a href="http://www.defendingyou.net">www.defendingyou.net</a> for more information.</p>'

aS'Parking structure accidents can be deadly; these are accidents that happen every year and is proven in the people that have been injured or killed, with the most recent being a 76 year old woman in West Los Angeles that was fatally injured when her Volkswagen SUV plunged from the fourth story of a parking structure April 26, 2011. \r\n<ul><li>October 8, 2010 an 83 year old man who crashed through a concrete barrier on the parking garage of his condominium building and amazingly survived the vehicles plunge to the pavement below. The man according to emergency personnel had head trauma and possible back injuries.</li>\r\n<li>April 16, 2010 in Huston Texas a 62 year old man was killed when the Toyota Sienna he was driving plunged from the upper floor of a parking garage.  He was pronounced dead after paramedics attempted chest compressions from the 20 foot fall from the second floor of the parking structure. The man according to reports was trying to park when his minivan went through the safety cables. </li>\r\n<li>January 23, 2011 a vehicle plunged from the fourth floor of the Golden Nugget parking structure in Las Vegas killing two people. Police believe the elderly man that was driving hit the gas instead of the break crashing through the concrete slab that killed him and his wife. The building inspector stated that the safety panel had blown out where it is embedded into the concrete and the concrete bolts and slabs are only meant to withstand approximately 6,000 pounds. </li>\r\n<li>Another of these tragic accidents was when a 15 year old Milwaukee teen was killed. This accident did not involve a vehicle the teen, a friend and his mother were walking near the building when a 30 foot wide piece of concrete facade fell from the parking structure. The other teen and his mother were seriously injured. </li></ul>\r\nThese are just some of the parking structure accidents that caused serious injuries or death and while partially the drivers fault in some cases the fact that the concrete slabs and bolts can only withhold approximately 6,000 pounds of pressure, the driver that accidently hits the gas instead of the breaks is going to be seriously injured or killed. \r\nAfter a parking garage accident in Los Angeles the injured victim or the family of a victim that was killed should speak with a parking structure injury attorney. These types of accidents the death or injuries can be cause by lack of proper maintenance or even manufacturing. \r\n<strong><p><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></strong>About the Author</p></strong>Michael Ehline of Ehline Law Firm PC, is a highly experienced personal injury lawyer and nationally recognized <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/pages/100091/parking-structure-personal-injury-lawyers.htm">parking structure injury attorney</a>.

Plaintiffs were employed as Pharmaceutical Sales Representatives (PSRs) for Defendant-Appellee SmithKline Beecham Corporation d/b/a GlaxoSmithKline (Glaxo). Glaxo classified Plaintiffs as &quot;outside salesmen&quot;-a legal designation that exempts an employee from the FLSA\'s overtime-pay requirement. Plaintiffs\' suit challenges Glaxo\'s classification and seeks back pay.</p><p>The district court granted summary judgment to Glaxo. We affirm.</p><p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p><p>I. Pharmaceutical Sales Representatives</p><p>Glaxo is in the business of developing, producing, marketing, and selling pharmaceutical products. Christopher and Buchanan began working as PSRs for Glaxo in 2003. Glaxo terminated Christopher in May 2007. Buchanan\'s career at Glaxo ended when he accepted a PSR position at another pharmaceutical company. Since the enactment of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, Pub.L. No. 59-384, 34 Stat. 768, federal law has, to varying degrees, regulated and influenced the sale of pharmaceuticals.<a class="mceItemAnchor" href="http://www.cftlawnews.com/#footnote&#95;1" name="footnote&#95;ref&#95;1" mce&#95;href="#footnote&#95;1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 1938, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Pub.L. 75-717, 52 Stat. 1040 (codified as amended at 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 301 et seq.), clothed the Food and Drug Administration with broad regulatory authority over, inter alia, drug manufacturers.<a class="mceItemAnchor" href="http://www.cftlawnews.com/#footnote&#95;2" name="footnote&#95;ref&#95;2" mce&#95;href="#footnote&#95;2"><sup>2</sup></a> The Durham-Humphrey Amendment of 1951 established the first comprehensive scheme governing the sale of prescription pharmaceuticals to the public. See Pub.L. No. 82-215, 65 Stat. 648 (1951) (codified at 21 U.S.C. &#167; 353(b)). Importantly, for our purposes, Durham-Humphrey formalized the now well-established distinction between prescription and over-the-counter drugs.<a class="mceItemAnchor" href="http://www.cftlawnews.com/#footnote&#95;3" name="footnote&#95;ref&#95;3" mce&#95;href="#footnote&#95;3"><sup>3</sup></a> The Controlled Substances Act of 1970, Pub.L. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1260, continues the prescription/non-prescription dichotomy, and prohibits dispensing the former without the authorization of a &quot;practitioner, other than a pharmacist, to an ultimate user.&quot; 21 U.S.C. &#167; 829(b)-(d). Currently, all pharmaceuticals requiring a physician\'s prescription are branded &quot;Rx only.&quot; 21 U.S.C. &#167; 353(b)(4)(A).</p><p>We analyze this case within the framework of how Glaxo sells its &quot;Rx only&quot; products to an &quot;ultimate user.&quot; A key, undisputed fact underlying our analysis is that the ultimate user-the patient-cannot purchase a prescription drug without first obtaining a physician\'s authorization.</p><p>Because Glaxo is proscribed from selling Rx-only products directly to the public, it sells its prescription pharmaceuticals to distributors or retail pharmacies, which then dispense those products to the ultimate user, as authorized by a licensed physician\'s prescription. In this restrictive sales environment, Glaxo employs PSRs to make &quot;calls&quot; on physicians to encourage them to prescribe Glaxo products. On calls, PSRs typically present physicians with a variety of information about Glaxo products, provide product samples, and attempt to convince the physicians to prescribe Glaxo products, when medically appropriate, over competitor products. PSRs also try to build business relationships with physicians, respond to their concerns, and recruit them to attend Glaxo-organized dinners and conventions. Each PSR is responsible for a particular &quot;drug bag&quot; of medications he or she tries to induce physicians to prescribe. As perceived by the Plaintiffs, the primary duty of a PSR is to communicate features and benefits of Glaxo products to physicians. In Buchanan\'s words, he tried to &quot;convince prescribers that the benefits of [Glaxo\'s] products warranted them prescribing that product to the appropriate patient.&quot;</p><p>PSRs usually work outside of a Glaxo office and spend much of their time traveling to the offices of, and working with, physicians within their assigned geographic territories. Plaintiffs visited between eight and ten physicians each day, usually between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Plaintiffs claim that they worked between ten and twenty hours each week outside of normal business hours, for which they received no overtime wages. When not making calls on physicians, Plaintiffs studied Glaxo products and relevant disease states, prepared new presentation modules, answered phone calls, checked email, generated reports, and attended events on evenings and weekends.</p><p>Before a PSR makes his or her daily calls, Glaxo provides him or her with detailed reports about the physicians he or she will visit. These reports include information about a physician\'s prescribing habits and drug preferences, the market volume of Glaxo products prescribed by the physician versus the volume of competitor products, and the volume of prescriptions filled in a particular region. Glaxo also provides each PSR with a budget to use for speaker programs and to engage socially with physicians.</p><p>Glaxo prepares and provides information about its products-called &quot;Core Messages&quot;-for PSRs to present to physicians during calls. Core Messages include information about product benefits and risks, dosage instructions, and the types of patients for whom Glaxo recommends each product. Glaxo expects PSRs to use the Core Messages and then &quot;[d]evelop and deliver informative sales presentations based on customer needs.&quot;</p><p>PSRs do not carry any prescriptions with them for direct sale; rather, Glaxo provides PSRs with small amounts of sample products to distribute to physicians. PSRs do not contact patients or market anything to them. To the contrary, in compliance with federal law, PSRs cannot sell the samples, take orders for any medication, or negotiate drug prices or contracts with either physicians or patients.</p><p>Glaxo recruits applicants who have prior sales experience for its PSR positions. When Glaxo hires new PSRs, it provides them with more than one month of training that focuses on making presentations, learning about Glaxo products, and building interpersonal skills. PSRs are taught how to ask for a commitment from a physician to prescribe Glaxo products if the physician believes the medication is appropriate.</p><p>Since 2001, Glaxo has instructed PSRs on various methods of completing a call. When Plaintiffs were hired, they received training in Glaxo\'s &quot;Assertive Selling Always Professional (ASAP)&quot; model. They were also trained to follow Glaxo\'s &quot;Winning Practices&quot; program. ASAP and Winning Practices are similarly structured and emphasize that a PSR should: (1) analyze and understand what is happening in an assigned region; (2) work with the team to drive results; (3) master professional knowledge to understand clinical management of patients; (4) prepare for calls; (5) &quot;Sell Through Customer-Focused Dialogue&quot;; (6) obtain the strongest commitment possible from a healthcare professional at the end of the call; and (7) provide added value to the customer relationship.</p><p>In 2004, Glaxo started a new program called &quot;When? Why? How?&quot; which distilled the old model into three questions PSRs should use to bond the targeted physician to the Glaxo brand: &quot;(1) When should I use this product? (2) Why should I use this product?

aS'<p>One of the core principles of our federal labor laws is that employees have the right to engage in concerted activity. Indeed, all employees enjoy the right to engage in concerted activities regardless of whether or not they enjoy the benefits of union representation. The National Labor Relations Board has long held that employee conduct disparaging management officials or an employer&#8217;s business may be protected concerted activity &#160;if the remarks or conduct relate to employee interests or working conditions and are not egregious in nature.</p><p>In today&#8217;s electronic environment, where employees have access to blogs and social networking media, employees have the opportunity to reach other employees and voice their concerns regarding their terms and conditions of employment. In fact, the availability and use of new-fangled electronic media is no different, in substance, from any other forum historically available to employees to express their dissatisfaction with unfair working conditions.</p><p>In other words, employee rights do not change merely because employees exercise those rights by way of the opportunities afforded by the Internet.</p><p>It is in recognition of these principles that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/business/09facebook.html?">NLRB has recently issued its first complaint</a> against an employer in Connecticut which discharged an employee because she posted comments critical of her supervisor on her Facebook page. &#160;In issuing this complaint against the employer, American Medical Response of Connecticut, the NLRB has noted in a <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/shared&#95;files/Press%20Releases/2010/R-2794.pdf">press release</a> that:</p><blockquote><p>When asked by her supervisor to prepare an investigative report concerning a customer complaint about her work, the employee requested and was denied representation from her union, Teamsters Local 443. Later that day from her home computer, the employee posted a negative remark about the supervisor on her personal Facebook page, which drew supportive responses from her co-workers, and led to further negative comments about the supervisor from the employee. The employee was suspended and later terminated for her Facebook postings and because such postings violated the company&#8217;s internet policies.</p><p>An NLRB investigation found that the employee&#8217;s Facebook postings constituted protected concerted activity, and that the company&#8217;s blogging and internet posting policy contained unlawful provisions, including one that prohibited employees from making disparaging remarks when discussing the company or supervisors and another that prohibited employees from depicting the company in any way over the internet without company permission. Such provisions constitute interference with employees in the exercise of their right to engage in protected concerted activity.</p></blockquote><p>This case will not be heard until 2011. We have every intention of keeping abreast of developments in this matter as they arise.</p><p>And kudos to the newly-revitalized NLRB for taking the first steps to ensure that employee rights are to be protected, whether they be exercised in the parking lot or on Facebook.</p><p><em>Attorney </em><a href="http://www.gallonlaw.com/index.php/areas-of-practice/labor/attorneys?view=employee&id=10"><em>John M.

Denise Brown was pregnant with her son, Darian, on January 10, 2000 when she went in for a regular doctor check-up. While monitoring the fetus, it came to the doctor&#8217;s attention that the heart rate of the baby was greater than 160, known as fetal tachycardia. Mrs. Brown was admitted to Broward General Hospital for observation since she was at risk for pre-term labor due to the high heart rate of the fetus. For three days, the hospital was able to stabilize the baby&#8217;s heartbeat and control Mrs. Brown&#8217; pre-term labor contractions. On the evening of January 14th the baby took a turn for the worse, but the hospital staff did not alert the doctors in spite of polices and procedures of the hospital. </p><p class="MsoNormal" MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"></p><p class="MsoNormal" MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Around 5am on January 15th, the hospital staff finally notified the doctors of the decline in the baby&#8217;s health and was finally delivered about two days later. Due to the delayed delivery, Darian suffers from severe brain damage and is unable to feed himself, walk, or make life decisions.&#160; After contacting attorney Nancy La Vista, the case was rigorously investigated and a medical malpractice suit was filed blaming doctors for failure to put into action a timely delivery. The nurses were also blamed for negligence in their failure of informing doctors as quickly as possible of the significant changes in the fetus&#8217;s heartbeat. After eight years of litigation, the Browns were finally rewarded their compensation by proving to the jury all of the mistakes made by the hospital staff.</p><p class="MsoNormal" MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"></p><p class="MsoNormal" MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">In 2008 Kentucky man, Phillip Seaton, 61, is began seeking compensation in a medical malpractice lawsuit against Dr. John M.

aS'In <a title="National Library of Medicine" href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/" target="&#95;blank">medicine</a> we are often told of the importance of getting a second opinion.

However, I like to take it a step further by saying that if you are dissatisfied with your existing attorney, there is nothing keeping you in that relationship. As someone who has been involved in the representation of clients who have discharged prior attorneys, I am happy to report that the contingent fee can be structured to protect the client.

If I, as a successor <a title="Bike Accident Lawyer in Boston" href="http://www.feinbergalban.com/practice-areas/auto-accidents/" target="&#95;blank">lawyer</a>, feel the case is worthwhile and would take it, I would not detriment the client by charging a second fee. Rather, both attorneys, the original and myself as successor, should split the originally contracted fee such that the client would not be paying one fee on top of the other.

The problem with&#160;Texas law prior to February 3, 2011?&#160; An attorney defending the dishonored check lawsuit&#160;took the position that the buisness owner's suit to collect a dishonored check <u>was not a contract claim</u> under section 38.001(8).&#160; That argument will no longer fly because of the Texas Supreme Court's decision on February 3, 2011 in <strong><em>1/2 Price Checks Cashed v. United Automobile Insurance Company</em></strong>.&#160;There, the defense attorney took the standard position that suit on the check was not contractual, but&#160;&quot;<em>purely statutory</em>&quot; (i.e., a claim under section 3.414 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which section does not provide for recovery of attorney's fees). The crux of a claim inder section 3.414 - whether brought by the payee of the check or the&#160;holder -&#160;is that the drawer (person that signed the check) possesses an obligation to pay the check according to its terms in the event the drawer's bank dishonors the instrument. The defense attorney basically said&#160;the business owner is&#160;suing under a statute, not on a contract. The Supreme Court was not impressed with that argument, holding that &quot;<em>it is settled law that a check - as a type of negotiable instrument - is a formal contract.&quot;</em>&#160; The court reasoned that when a drawer does not honor the obligation to pay&#160;and the holder sues the drawer, the suit is on the instrument - and thus the contract - itself.&#160; The court concluded that a holder of the dishonored check who prevails on a section 3.414 contract claim against the drawer&#160;is entitled, as the prevailing party,&#160;to recover attorney's fees under section 38.001(8).&#160; </p><p>A business owner can now hire an attorney to file suit on the dishonored check and recover not only the amount of the check, but&#160;the reasonable and necessary attorney's fees for having to do so. Check writing scofflaws beware.&#160; Should your bank dishonor&#160;your check, you will now pay the attorney's fee of the payee/holder of the check should it prevail in the lawsuit.&#160;</p><p>Nothing in this post should be considered legal advice.&#160; Let's face it, chances are good that we don't know each other.&#160; My aim is simple - to provide the reader with some useful, but general, information about the topic.

aS"<p>&#160; It is not the forms which make it complex -- although, the instructions which accompany the filling out of the Standard Forms make it appear more convoluted than necessary.&#160; Federal Disability Retirement for FERS &amp; CSRS employees of the Federal Government and the U.S. Postal Service is actually quite simple in conceptual terms, and in the process of attempting to win an approval from the Office of Personnel Management, we encounter the complexity of the entire administrative process, thereby overlooking the simplicity of the actual law underlying the process. That is why it is often a good idea to periodically pause and &quot;go back to basics&quot; before moving forward on a disability retirement application.&#160; As stated multiple times, disability retirement is essentially the linking of a &quot;nexus&quot; between one's medical conditions, and one's Federal or Postal position.&#160; By &quot;linking&quot; is meant the following:&#160; Does the medical condition from which one suffers prevent one from performing one or more of the essential elements of one's job?&#160; If the answer to the question is &quot;yes&quot;, then you have passed the preliminary, fundamental, preconditional question. The next question, or series of questions, of course, include the following:&#160; Do you have the minimum of 18 months of Federal Service (for CSRS individuals, 5 years)?&#160; Do you have a supportive doctor?&#160; Will your medical condition last for at least 1 year?&#160; These are just some of the basic, preliminary questions to ask, before considering the option of filing for Federal Disability retirement benefits.&#160; The questions and answers themselves are simple; as one gets more and more involved in the process, they become, in combination, procedurally and substantively a complex issue of meeting the legal criteria for approval.&#160; Underlying it all is a simple conceptual basis; the complexity comes in applying the law.</p><p>Sincerely, Robert R.

aS'Franchisors often make missteps and mistakes in selling a franchise opportunity. Generally\r\n these arise in two categories: 1) misrepresentations in the disclosure \r\ndocuments provided to prospective franchisees; and 2) failure to know \r\nand follow the procedural requirements during the sales process. \r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n</div>\r\n<div text-align: justify;">\r\n</div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n<strong>1. <u>Misrepresentations</u>.</strong> All\r\nfranchisors must give a prospective franchisee a franchise disclosure document\r\n(FDD) prior to entering into a franchise sale. The FDD has 23 sections and\r\nhundreds of specific issues that must be disclosed to the prospective\r\nfranchisee prior to entering into a franchise agreement. Just providing an FDD\r\nis not enough &#8211; it must be materially correct and not misleading. The\r\nconsequences for inaccurate information can be severe. &#160;Some of the areas that are regularly\r\ninaccurately disclosed include the following:</div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n</div>\r\n<div text-align: justify;">\r\n</div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; a. <u>Supplier\r\nrebates</u>. Supplier rebates not only pertains to actual rebates that the\r\nfranchisor may receive from suppliers due to franchisee purchases, but also applies\r\nto any other benefit that the franchisor receives from the supplier due to the\r\nfranchisee purchases. </div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n</div>\r\n<div text-align: justify;">\r\n</div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; b.\r\n<u>Territorial rights and restrictions</u>. Often the FDD will not accurately define\r\nthe territorial rights of the franchisee and will fail to correctly disclose\r\nthe franchisor&#8217;s reservations. If this is not clear and a dispute arises in the\r\nfuture, the franchisor may be more vulnerable to a lawsuit by the franchisee. </div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n</div>\r\n<div text-align: justify;">\r\n</div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; c. <u>Start up\r\ncosts</u>. The franchisor is required to provide the prospective franchisee with an\r\naccurate estimation of the startup costs for opening a franchise. Often this\r\ninformation is inaccurately reported in order to show a lower cost investment\r\nto help entice franchisees to purchase the franchise. However, this can be very\r\ndangerous for the franchisor. This is one of the easiest ways for a franchisee\r\nto show inaccuracy in the FDD provided by the franchisor. </div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n</div>\r\n<div text-align: justify;">\r\n</div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n<strong>2. <u>Procedural Requirements</u>.</strong> Under the FTC Franchise\r\nRule, there are very specific rules related to providing disclosures, waiting\r\nperiods and restrictions on what franchisors can tell a franchise prior to\r\ncompleting a franchise sale. If your franchise sellers do not follow the rules\r\nfor franchise sales, the franchise sale may be illegal and lead to serious\r\nconsequences, such as rescission of the franchise agreement by the franchisee. Some\r\nof the common mistakes include:</div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n</div>\r\n<div text-align: justify;">\r\n</div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; a. <u>Receipt\r\npage</u>. Failing to collect a signed receipt page after sending the disclosure\r\ndocument to a prospective franchisee. Under the FTC Franchise Rule, the\r\nfranchisor must keep a copy of all receipts for 3 years, whether or not the\r\nprospective franchisee purchases the franchise or not. This is the best defense to show that the FDD was provided\r\nand show that the waiting period was met. Too often the franchisor does not\r\nhave this document when a problem arises with a franchisee. </div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n</div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n</div>\r\n<div text-align: justify;">\r\n</div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; b. <u>Waiting\r\nperiod</u>. Not waiting the full 14 day period before collecting money or signing a\r\nbinding agreement. Under the rule, the franchisor must send the FDD and give\r\nthe prospective franchisee a full 14 days to review the documents.</div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n</div>\r\n<div text-align: justify;">\r\n</div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; c. <u>Earnings\r\nclaims</u>. Providing financial performance representations also known as earnings\r\nclaims, either verbal or written, outside the FDD. Under the rule, the franchisor\r\nmay provide numbers on historic or projected earnings ONLY within Item 19 of\r\nthe FDD. There are certain disclosures and cautions that the franchisor must also\r\nprovide with this information. Often sales staff will give out numbers that can\r\nbe construed as financial performance representations. Even if these are\r\naccurate numbers, the rule only allows this information to be provided if it is\r\nin the FDD with the required cautions and warnings. </div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n</div>\r\n<div text-align: justify;">\r\n</div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; d. <u>State\r\nregistrations</u>. Some states require that the franchisor register its FDD with\r\nthe state prior to selling (or even offering to sell) franchises in the state.\r\nToo often sales staff will offer a franchise or sell a franchise to a person\r\nwho is in a registration state or plans to open the franchise in a registration\r\nstate, without knowing if the franchisor&#8217;s FDD has been registered. This sort\r\nof action can create a rescission action for any contract entered into and it\r\ncan also trigger fines and fees from the registration state. If the action is\r\nin blatant violation of the law, it may cause the state to disallow any further\r\nfranchise sales in the state by the franchisor. </div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n</div>\r\n<div text-align: justify;">\r\n</div>\r\n<div text-align: justify;">\r\n</div>\r\n<div text-align: justify;">\r\n</div>\r\n<div margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">\r\n<br />\r\nAll of these issues can be avoided by ensuring that you\r\nprovide accurate information to the attorney preparing your disclosure documents, regularly update your FDD for any material\r\nchanges to the franchise system, and train your\r\nfranchise sellers to understand the rules required to sell franchises. </div><!--more-->Avoid these common mistakes made by franchisors when selling a franchise.

aS'<p class="MsoNormal">In my 30 years of experience representing claimants in social security disability hearings, I have concluded there are five factors that are significant in almost every case. These are the factors one should consider when applying for disability.</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>1.&#160; SERIOUS IMPAIRMENT: You cannot get disability for a hangnail. Your impairment must seriously affect your ability to work. It must be an impairment that will last or can be expected to last for more than 12 months.&#160;In my 30 years of practice, I have always found Social Security Judges to be very sympathetic to a claimant with a serious impairment such as lupus or cancer.</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>&#160;2.&#160; <b>YOUR AGE</b>: It is best to be 55 years old or older when applying for disability. The system favors the older applicant. On the other hand if you are under 50 years of age you may have to show you cannot do any job that exists in the national economy. It does not take much physical ability to be a greeter at a Walmart store or a security monitor watcher. If you are under age 50 you will have to show you cannot do those types of jobs.</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>3.&#160; YOUR OWN DOCTOR\'S OPINION: Social Security has a rule that can help most applicants. That rule says if your own doctor\'s opinion is well reasoned and based on many clinical visits by you over a period of time then his/her opinion can be granted &quot;controlling weight&quot; in your case. Thus, if your doctor supports your claim, then you have a great chance to win your case. In my experience, 100% support by the claimant\'s own doctor is crucial to success in a claim for disability. I have had a number of cases where the United States District Court has reversed a Social Security Administrative Law Judge precisely because the Social Security Judge did not give enough weight to the opinion of the claimant\'s own doctor.</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>4.&#160;&amp; 5.&#160; YOUR SKILL AND EDUCATIONAL LEVEL: Unfortunately, the more education you have and the more skills you have the harder it is going to be to win a disability case. For example, even if you are over 55 years of age and have a serious orthopaedic impairment&#160;but you still can do some sort of clerical work at a desk, you probably will not be found to be disabled. This is especially true if your past skills and education indicate you can do clerical work. However, all is not lost if you can show your impairment prevents you from &quot;sitting&quot; to do clerical work or if your impairment prevents you from the very light repetitive work required of clerical work. On the other hand if you have less than a high school education, a history of manual labor, you are 55 years old, and you have an orthopaedic impairment that prevents manual labor, then you are on your way to a winning case. </p><p /><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>&#160;<b>THE OPINION OF A SPECIALIST</b>: If you have an impairment such as lupus, some type of cancer, or fibromyalgia, the opinion of your family doctor (although beneficial) will probably not carry the day. What you need is the support of a specialist who treats the particular impairment you have. For example, with fibromyalgia you would need to consult a specialist in arthritis or rheumatology. He or she would at a minimum have to say your fibromyalgia met the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for the disease. For cancer, you probably need the opinion of an oncologist.</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>&#160;<b>SUMMARY</b>, In my 30 years of practice and in doing over 1,000 hearings I have found the above five factors to be the most important elements of a winning disability case. However, even knowing these factors, it is no substitute for not contacting an experienced Social Security Disability Lawyer.</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>&#160;This may be considered AN ADVERTISEMENT or Advertising Material under the Rules of Professional Conduct governing lawyers in Virginia.

aS'<p class="MsoNormal">\r\nOne of the most destructive types of truck crashes is a runaway trailer accident. Runaway trailer accidents occur when a truck&#8217;s trailer becomes disconnected from the cab. A large trailer can weigh anywhere from 10,000 pounds empty to more than 30,000 pounds fully loaded with cargo. An unmanned trailer barreling down the road or highway can destroy anything in its path, including passenger vehicles, motorcyclists and bicyclists. Occupants of a passenger vehicle, a motorcycle\r\nrider or a cyclist can suffer catastrophic injuries in a runaway trailer accident. </p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Runaway Trailer Catastrophic Injuries</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">If a victim survives a potentially life-threatening catastrophic injury, the victim may never be able to return to their previous way of life. Catastrophic injury survivors often rely on caregivers to help them perform daily tasks, such as eating, dressing and bathing. Some catastrophic injury survivors suffer from severe secondary injuries, which require constant medical care. Other catastrophic injury victims suffer permanent neurological damage, organ dysfunction or paralysis. Examples of catastrophic injuries include:</p><p class="MsoNormal" /><ul><li>Spinal cord injuries &#8211; can result in incomplete or complete paralysis</li><li>Head injuries &#8211; may result in mild, moderate or severe brain damage</li><li>Burn injures &#8211; can result in first, second or third degrees burns</li><li>Bone fracture injuries &#8211; may result in permanent disfigurement&#160;</li><li>Internal organ injuries &#8211; can result in permanent organ dysfunction</li><li>Amputation injuries &#8211; may result in partial or complete loss of limb.</li></ul><p /><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Fighting for Your Future</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">Suffering a catastrophic injury in a truck collision often places enormous physical, emotional and financial stress on a victim. With the help of an understanding <a href="http://www.truck-accident-injury-attorneys.com/">California truck accident injury attorney</a>, victims can recover the highest amount of compensation possible.

aS"The <i>LA Times</i> recently reported, &#8220;With a high DUI rate and residents complaining of drunks on the streets, the city of Huntington Beach has imposed restrictions and employed new police tactics.&#8221;&#160; Unfortunately however, the story also revealed that tax money generated by partiers is still much needed, city leaders say. &#160;<br /><br />The investigation begins about 1:30 a.m. on a recent Friday in Huntington Beach's Main Street, typically busy by this time of night with bar crowd foot traffic.&#160; The scene described by the <i>Times</i> reporter was the following, &#8220;the air is crisp and salty, and despite the cold, women in colorful tube dresses are laughing and men in collared shirts are whistling in appreciation.&#8221;&#160; Sound familiar to residents of Orange County?&#160;&#160; &#160;<br /><br />Next, the report indicates that Police Sgt. James Schoales standing on a busy corner poses a familiar question to a 24-year-old man who is stumbling up the brick sidewalk.&#160; Schoales asks the man, &quot;How much have you had to drink tonight?&quot;&#160; The response is surprisingly not uncommon to a veteran officer and described by the reporter with whimsical accuracy,<br /><br /><i>The man, whose long light brown hair is disheveled, responds with uncanny precision,&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; counting on his fingers, and he slurs, but only slightly: &#8216;A Mind Eraser, Two shots of Jack Daniels, A Guinness and a Pabst Blue Ribbon, Two Irish Car Bombs, then three Bud Lights!&#8217;</i> &#160;<br /><br />Smiling, Schoales directs him to a line of cabs, the <i>Times</i> reporter explains.&#160; So how indicative is this encounter of a Friday night in Huntington?&#160; This particular night, the officers on duty &#8220;will break up two brawls, encounter a man passed out in the front seat of a cab and arrest a 21-year-old who voluntarily jumped off a 20-foot building. They will also usher numerous drunks home and aid others in finding a ride.&#8221;<p>In addition, local bartenders tell tales of throwing naked men out of clubs and breaking up bloody fights to the Times.&#160; Another unbelievable part of the story is this: &#8220;drunks wander so often into the wrong house looking for a place to sleep that police gave it a term &#8212; a &quot;Downtown 459&quot; &#8212; named after the state's penal code number for a burglary, since a resident's initial panicked call is because they think someone is trying to rob them.&#8221;</p><p>This sounds more like New Orleans than a city in California but sadly (in this case) the stats don&#8217;t lie.&#160; Huntington Beach is currently ranked number one in victims killed and injured in alcohol-involved traffic accidents among cities its size in California, according to the story, and DUI arrests are more than twice the number in Irvine, a college town roughly the same size.</p><p>Moreover, with 1,419 DUI arrests last year and a clear problem on their hands, city officials decided they needed to tackle the problem, hence the Times piece was subsequently written.&#160; In fact, the story revealed the &#8220;City Council placed restrictions on new bars &#8212; no beer pong or drink minimums, for example &#8212; and police began tracking where people had their last drink before their arrests.&#8221; </p>So is the new crack down working? Residents say, &#8220;urination, defecation, sex acts and theft are products of the&#160;alcohol problem and of a concentration of alcohol licenses in the area,&#8221; according to the story.&#160; Perhaps now is time for locals to have a voice on this issue and legislature to step in?&#160; It seems that the end goal is safety but the people in Huntington are far from reaching it.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;"

aS'<p>Bills similar to this have passed the Florida Senate many times only to fail in the House of Representatives. To date, there are thirty nine states plus the District of Columbia that have adopted bans on texting while driving. SB 52 outlaws texting while driving and was voted 9-0 in favor of this ban by the Florida Senate Communications Committee; however, it exempts emergency vehicles including the police. This ban makes texting a secondary crime, which means the police can cite a driver for texting, but only if they are stopped for other violations like speeding.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions set forth by SB 52, the violation of the law will result in a fine of $30. In addition, if the violation results in or causes an accident, the driver&#8217;s license of the driver would be deducted 6 points.For this, you may need a <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://jamesdavisdefense.com/">criminal defense lawyer in Jacksonville</a>.</p><p>A Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles spokeswoman Courtney Heidelberg said the safety records for Florida highways show 171,538 vehicle crash reports filed in 2011&#8217;s first ten months involved 149 drivers that when the accident happened, were texting. The AAA&#8217;s foundation for Traffic Safety held a study that showed the concern for distracted driving is a growing concern, but still a common practice.\r\n\r\n</p><p>This study is known as the Traffic Safety Index and was put together based upon information received from 3,896 US residents age 16 and over. The conclusion of the index was that even though a lot of Americans do value their safety when driving and do support the laws that support unsafe driving such as speeding, they still tend to practice unsafe driving habits. The findings of the index were 88.5 percent of the drivers thought that using a cell phone during driving was a serious threat to the safety of motorist. In addition there were 67.3 percent who felt that being distracted while driving is a much bigger problem than it was just three years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Even with many of the people who were surveyed being concerned about people who were distracted while driving, they were for having a double standard in regards to measures that would discourage this behavior. As many as 68.8 percent confessed to having used a cell phone while driving at least one time within a 30 day period. As many as 31.9 percent confessed to using a cell phone &#8220;fairly often.&#8221; Only 57.9 percent of people surveyed considered using a cell phone when driving a serious safety threat and only 66 percent thought the practice as &#8220;unacceptable.&#8221; Unfortunately, it seems that distracted driving is a problem in the US that is growing.\r\n\r\nBecause of the increase of electronic devices, responsible drivers must always be alert to unsafe and distracted drivers. </p><p>If you or anyone you know has been in a traffic accident where you sustained injuries, it is in your best interest and to protect your right to compensation that you get legal representation right away.

These motorcycle collisions are caused by drivers that cut off the oncoming motorcycle when making a left turn. </p><p>A research study that was conducted by the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a> discovered many drivers, especially at intersections claim they did not see the motorcycle before the crash or when they did see it the collision was unavoidable. \r\nThere is the fact that the rider of a motorcycle does not have the same protection as the driver of a vehicle, there are no seatbelts or airbags and there is no metal that is protecting the rider. </p><p>Being on two wheels is an excitement the driver will never know, plus the economical reasons for riding a motorcycle today, with the cost of gasoline steadily rising. Being on two wheels does have its drawbacks when the rider is involved in a collision, because they have none of the protections afforded to drivers. \r\nAnother fact about dangers to motorcycle riders is the hours of darkness, this is when drivers are not as likely to see the bike or the rider, even if they are wearing clothing that is bright, until it is too late to avoid the collision. \r\n</p><p>In any of these instances on Torrance roadways the motorcycle rider is in danger of being injured and it can take weeks or months for the injuries to heal.

aS'<p>California is considered a fault or tort state with regard to auto accidents. In California, a person must be found to be responsible for causing the accident before that person&#8217;s insurance will pay for damages. This is in contrast to the no-fault states, such as Florida and New Jersey, where there is no requirement to prove fault and the injured person collects from his own insurance company for medical costs and lost wages; the injured party cannot sue the party at fault for additional monies unless the state allows for special circumstances. The state in which the accident occurred will govern the case. Therefore, it is important to contact an attorney who knows accident law and can help you understand your rights. </p><p>California is a tort state which requires that a party must prove fault before there is legal liability. With regard to auto accidents, this means that the injured party must show that the other party negligently caused the accident. California follows the pure comparative negligence law. This allocates fault between parties and will reduce any recovery accordingly. For example, if damages in a case are $10,000 and you are considered 80% at fault, you can still recover damages for the remaining 20% or $2,000. Each party&#8217;s negligence is compared to the others and damages are awarded according to percentage of fault.</p><p>California cases involving fault issues are often complicated. That is when you need an attorney experienced in handling auto accidents and comparative negligence matters.

Insurance Director Merle Scheiber signed on behalf of South Dakota, which collected nearly $29 million in excess and surplus lines premium in 2009. With the addition of South Dakota, NIMA states now represent 19.6% of the surplus lines market according to 2009 data.</p><p>NIMA is an agreement that provides a mechanism to report, collect, allocate and distribute surplus lines tax revenues consistent with the Non-Admitted and Reinsurance Reform Act (NRRA). The NRRA became part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform legislation passed in 2010 that allows only the home state to require premium tax payments for non-admitted insurance. Without this agreement, several states could potentially lose surplus lines tax revenues; the lack of an agreement could create distortions in the marketplace.</p><p>The participating states now include Florida, Mississippi, Hawaii, Connecticut, Louisiana and South Dakota.&#160; Several states have passed legislation and expressed interest in joining NIMA, but are prohibited from officially joining until the July 21, 2011 deadline established in the federal legislation. NIMA member states plan to wait until after the July 21 deadline to elect officers and select a clearinghouse to administer the funds.&#160; The State of Florida has agreed to temporarily house the NIMA website, which will contain the signature documents from member states.</p>'

aS'A collision between two trucks recently on Interstate 57 in Union County is yet another example of the common causes and frequency of major trucking accidents in Alabama. <p>James Woodly, 45, of Greenville, Miss., had legally parked his truck along the right side of the southbound lanes on I-57 to check his vehicle. At about 2 a.m. Warren Gross, 31, of Bloomfield, Mo., for unknown reasons, drove his semi across the fog line and collided with the left side of Woodley\'s parked truck. Gross\'s vehicle continued on until it veered into a ditch on the right shoulder.</p><p>The vehicles sustained major damage and had to be towed from the scene, but luckily there were no injuries reported. It is important to contact a reliable <a href="http://www.frankmwilsonpc.com/trucking-accidents/" target="&#95;blank">Alabama trucking accident attorney</a> if you are ever injured in a truck accident.&#160; If James Woodley had been in the driver\'s seat of his truck rather than outside checking it, he might not have walked away from the accident. </p><p>The accident is still under investigation, but there are several factors common to truck accidents that may indicate what caused the crash. The first and most apparent factor was the time of day. It was the dead of night, several hours before sunrise. Vehicle headlights cannot provide the clarity of daylight, and the repetitious, dark surroundings can make a driver feel very tired. These factors greatly impare one\'s driving ability, and are likely what Warren Gross was experiencing right before the accident. Because of his exhaustion, Gross probably did not notice that he was drifting onto the shoulder nor see Woodley\'s parked tractor-trailer.&#160;This is the conclusion we would draw from the&#160;few details provided by the <em><a href="http://www.carmitimes.com/area&#95;news/x1902476824/Semi-hits-parked-tractor-trailer-on-I-57-early-Tuesday" target="&#95;blank">CarmiTimes</a></em>.</p><p>Truck drivers are supposed to be skilled professionals in their trade, however that is not always the case. There are a few reasons that a truck driver might not be preforming as well as he should: </p><ul><li>Inadequate driver training </li><li>Lack of diligence in addressing safety concerns </li><li>Driver compensation that encourages faster driving </li><li>Drivers expected to handle more hours of consecutive vehicle operation than is safe </li><li>Delivery schedules that encourage drivers to overlook safety factors</li></ul><p>A truck accident can leave a victim with life-threatening injuries. In order to receive the compensation necessary to fully recover from a truck accident, you need serious representation. From his years as an <a href="http://www.frankmwilsonpc.com/truck-accidents/" target="&#95;blank">Alabama truck accident lawyer</a>, Frank M.

aS'<p>Some common questions asked by adoptive parents are: &quot;Do I have to file additional paperwork with U.S. immigration?&quot; &quot;Do I have to go to state court?&quot; &quot;What do I do if I want to get a Texas birth certificate or name change?&quot;&#160; </p><p><u>U.S. Immigration:</u>&#160; </p><p>In most cases, whether or not you need to file additional paperwork with U.S. Immigration will depend on two things:&#160; </p><p>a) what type of visa the child had to enter the US (whether the adoption was full and final), and b) <u>when</u> the child entered the US.&#160; </p><p /><p>a) The type of visa</p><p>In some cases, the adoptive parents will have to re-adopt when they bring the child to the U.S.&#160;&#160; These children will have entered on an IR-4 (or IH-4) visa.&#160; These children need to have a full and final adoption completed in the US by their 16th birthdays and then paperwork must be filed with the US Immigration service on their behalf.&#160;&#160; </p><p>Children who come in to the US with an IR-2 visa will also have to complete an immigration&#160;process. These children were adopted overseas and have already lived with the adoptive parent or parents for at least 2 years prior to coming to the U.S.</p><p>Children who came in with an IR-3 visa (or IH-3) have already had an adoption that is full and final for immigration purposes.&#160; If they have already received their certificate of citizenship from U.S. immigration then the parents only need to decide whether they wish to file in state court for other reasons (see below).</p><p /><p>b. When the child entered</p><p>Another consideration is <u>when </u>the child entered.&#160; The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 granted automatic citizenship to certain children, and some of the children who entered the US&#160;with the Act in effect became&#160;US citizens automatically and&#160;received certificates of citizenship.&#160; This Act will&#160;not apply&#160;to children who&#160;became 18 prior to February 27, 2001, (they have other options).&#160; There are also some children who are entitled to the benefits of the Act but may not have received an automatic citizenship certificate and may need to apply. </p><p>A parent who thinks that their child is entitled to receive a certificate of citizenship and did not receive one should follow up with US immigration or obtain the help of an attorney. </p><p /><p><u>Texas Court</u></p><p>Under Texas law, an&#160;adoption order rendered by a foreign country to a Texas resident&#160;will be given &quot;full faith and credit&quot; unless it violates &quot;the fundamental principles of human rights or the laws or public policies of the state&quot;.&#160; A foreign adoption order may be &quot;registered&quot;, &quot;recognized&quot;&#160;or &quot;reaffirmed&quot;&#160;(this terms are often used interchangeably) by a Texas Court. </p><p>Adoptive parents may&#160;need to file for &quot;re-adoption&quot; in a Texas court to obtain a &quot;full and final&quot; adoption, (as explained above).&#160; But even when&#160;the foreign adoption was &quot;full and final&quot;&#160;adoptive parents often choose to do so in order to obtain a Texas birth certificate. Whenever a birth certificate is needed for an official reason it is much more convenient to&#160;produce a Texas birth certificate (one page), than to have to show several pages of documents with translations.</p><p /><p>Other Considerations</p><p>In addition to satisfying U.S. Immigration, a parent will have to show&#160;official documentation in order to put the child on health insurance, and to obtain federal tax credits. </p><p>There are people in the U.S. who were adopted as children and never had the paperwork process completed properly.&#160; This can lead to serious problems with proving work eligibility, obtaining a driver\'s license, getting financial aid, and attending college. An immigration attorney can evaluate&#160;such cases and explain any available options. </p><p>Although the paperwork process in a foreign adoption can seem overwhelming at times, my advice is &quot;Don\'t quit when you\'re almost there!&quot;&#160; Those last final, steps are crucial. It is much easier to complete the process now than to fix a problem later! </p><p /><p>Laura Kalish is a partner at Kalish Law Office in The Woodlands, Texas and practices in the areas of domestic and foreign adoption and family-based immigration.

How many children have <a title="cerebral palsy" href="http://www.birthinjurynashlawteam.com/birth-injuries/index.html#cerebral-palsy" target="&#95;blank">cerebral palsy</a>?</strong></p><p>An estimated 6,000&#8211;10,000 infants and children are diagnosed with this condition each year.&#160; It is estimated that somewhere between 500,000 to 750,000 children and adults in the United States manifest one or more symptoms of cerebral palsy.</p><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the name given to a group of movement disorders, ranging from limbs being very rigid in some children and very flaccid in others. CP\'s motor component can affect just the lower limbs (paraplegia or diplegia), the arm and leg of one side of the body (hemiplegia), or all four limbs (quadriplegia). Essentially, it is believed that damage to portions of the brain occurs before birth, during birth, or in some cases relatively soon after birth and even during early childhood. At times, this diagnosis is not made until many months&#8212;sometimes years&#8212;after a child is born</p><strong>2. How can Social Security insurance help me?</strong><p>People often associate <a title="Social Security" href="http://www.ssa.gov/" target="&#95;blank">Social Security</a> benefits with the elderly, but a person with a disability that inhibits his or her ability to work may be eligible for Social Security insurance benefits (SSI).&#160; This applies to children under the age of 18.&#160; The amount of benefits to which your child may be entitled varies.&#160; We have the resources available to assist you in determining whether your child may be eligible for SSI benefits.</p><strong>3. Should I set up a special needs trust for my child?</strong><p>A special needs trust is generally a good idea for a child who requires specific medical care, should anything happen to the child\'s legal guardians.&#160; In addition to what the government may provide, this trust grants supplemental care to your child and stipulates the specifics about his or her medical needs.&#160; In instances where your child may receive <a title="SSI" href="http://www.ssa.gov/pgm/links&#95;ssi.htm" target="&#95;blank">SSI benefits</a>, a special needs trust is necessary to protect SSI benefits and still get the benefit of financial recoveries through litigation. It may be possible to leave your assets directly to a loved one with directions to care for your child. A special needs trust may even be established&#160; to prohibit any disinheritance or vulnerability of those assets to creditors or collections in times of financial distress. </p><p><strong>Nash &amp; Associates - </strong><a title="Maryland Birth Injury Attorneys" href="http://www.birthinjurynashlawteam.com/birth-injuries/" target="&#95;blank"><strong>Maryland Birth Injury Attorneys</strong></a></p><div id="address">Cromwell Center</div><div>809 Gleneagles Court, Suite 201</div><div>Baltimore, Maryland 21286 </div><div><strong>(800) 690-7895</strong></div><!--more--><a title="Maryland birth injury lawyers" href="http://www.birthinjurynashlawteam.com/" target="&#95;blank">Maryland birth injury lawyers</a> of Nash &amp; Associates answer frequently asked questions regarding <strong>birth injury lawsuits</strong>.

aS'I used to think email was a problem. Until about a month ago. Now I love it. The problem was what to do with it. I used to treat email like any other correspondence. When law offices first starting email in the 1990s,&#160;I would print it on paper, drop it in the wooden box of incoming mail on my desk, and deal with it when I dealt with that day&#8217;s U.S. Mail. That worked for a while, but email usage has become widespread, voluminous and constant.&#160; Printing to paper could not keep up with the onslaught.&#160; One month I had 800 emails on just one client&#8217;s case. I needed an email filing solution. And I found one, right there on my computer, right under my nose, right there under my typing finger tips.&#160; It&#8217;s called Microsoft Outlook. That&#8217;s right. The very same software that brings me the email is now my email filing solution and records management solution.<!--more-->Email has become the de facto office communication system. Why not use it as the filing system, too?'

aS'<b>What boaters should know if an accident happens&#8230;</b><br /><br />Summer is in full swing. With the Fourth of July just around the corner, fun on the water is calling. Unfortunately, many boaters are not prepared or even unaware of the laws governing the waterways.&#160; In the event of an accident or incident, do boaters understand what their responsibilities?<br /><br />Our waterways are patrolled by up to five agencies. Under federal law, boaters are required to report watercraft and <a href="http://clorelaw.com/practice-areas/watercraftboat-accident/" title="Charleston boat accident lawyer">boating accidents</a> to the authorities, even minor ones. In South Carolina, reports should be made to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR).<br /><br /><b>When and whether to file a report:</b><br />The operator of each watercraft involved in an accident is responsible for filing, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. The responsibility falls upon to the boat owner should the operator be physically unable to report an incident.<br /><br />When the following occurs, the operator or owner is required to report a boating accident within 48 hours:<br /><br /><ul><li>A personal injury requires medical treatment beyond first aid.</li><li>A person is missing from the vessel and death or injury is suspected.</li><li>A person dies within 24 hours of the occurrence. </li></ul><br />When an accident involving any watercraft or its equipment involving any of these situations, boaters are required to report within 10 days:<br /><br /><ul><li>Property Damage of $2,000 or more </li><li>There is a complete loss of any vessel</li><li>A person dies more than 24 hours after the occurrence</li></ul><br />Minor accidents not addressed above do not require reporting; however, if a person suffering injury which requires a trip to the ER you must report the incident.<br /><br />These laws are important for boaters to understand and abide by them.&#160; Charleston area doctors and medical professionals understand the reporting rules and will report incidents to the proper authorities. In such an instance, boaters can be cited for not reporting the incident. Authority will often want to administer toxicology tests too, since alcohol is frequently a contributing factor in boating accidents.<br /><br />Failure to report an accident to authorities may be considered by insurance companies when filing a claim.<br /><br />As the temperature increases, so too does the number of boaters on the water around Charleston. It&#8217;s imperative for watercraft operators and owners to understand the laws and safety regulations. As a <a href="www.clorelaw.com" title="Charleston personal injury attorney">personal injury attorney</a> who handles cases resulting from boating accidents, I can attest to what happens when the rules are not followed. Refinance of the laws on the water&#160; result in far more damage than that of the boating accident.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><!--more-->Each summer, the Charleston boating injury attorneys at Clore Law Group prepare for the increase in watercraft related injuries and death. With nearly 800,000 vessels register in the Carolina\'s, boat accidents are going to occur. Understanding the laws governing the waterways will help everyone on the water.'

For many boaters, a day planned water skiing, wakeboarding or fishing on one of Sacramento&#8217;s waterways can quickly end tragically. In 2009, boating accidents were responsible for the deaths of 736 Americans.

Passengers can also be thrown from a vessel that is going too fast. </p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Improper lookout</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">Operators who fail to keep their eyes &#8220;on the road&#8221; and keep a lookout for other vessels caused more than 330 boating accidents in 2009. </p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Alcohol</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">The consumption of alcohol or drugs can affect an operator&#8217;s ability to think clearly, react quickly and stay focused. </p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Machinery failure</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">An electrical system failure, faulty battery charger, fuel pump crack, rudder defect, steering arm malfunction or throttle defect can cause a Sacramento boating crash.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Weather</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">Weather conditions, such as rain, fog or strong winds, contributed to more than 260 U.S. vessel accidents in 2009.&#160; </p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Hazardous waters</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">Rocky or turbulent waters, oftentimes hidden under the surface of the water, can catch even an experienced boat operator off guard and quickly turn a fun day of recreational boating into a tragic one.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Force of wave/wake</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">Boats traveling across the surface of a body of water produce a wake, which is a disruption in the flow of water. The size of the wake produced depends on the size of the boat. Large boats produce large wake. Small boats can be sunk if caught in the wake of a large boat. If powerful or large enough, waves can also overtake a boat. </p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Rules of the road</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">Just as drivers must follow the rules of the road while operating a vehicle, operators must follow boating regulations and laws when operating a vessel. Boat\r\noperators who fail to obey laws and regulations can cause a devastating boat crash. </p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>When to Contact a Sacramento Boating Accident Lawyer</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">If you or a loved one has been seriously injured in an accident involving a vessel, the sooner you contact a skilled <a href="http://www.sacramento-personalinjurylawyers.com/boating-accident.html">Sacramento boating accident lawyer</a> the better your chances are of recovering maximum compensation.

A personal injury lawyer is a professional lawyer that can help you get the appropriate representation if you have been involved in accident wherein you are the victim.

Professionals have certification and licenses that proves their expertise but through experience they learn more and eventually become an expert.

In fact, your chance of winning depends greatly on the person who represents you. </p><p dir="ltr">In cases of auto accidents, lawyers are up against the insurance company.

For these cases, a personal injury lawyer that charges you after winning the case will be more helpful. You will have an agreement that would be beneficial to both of you. The charges vary from 20% to 25% of the total compensation that you are claiming. If your lawyer lost the case, he or she will not be compensated, but if your case won, your lawyer is getting a percentage of the total amount compensated. This is called a contingency basis.

aS'<p>While there are some differences with automobile, trucking accidents - these types of cases often times have a degree of common elements. But when you&#8217;re dealing with interstate trucking firms for example, there is a set of laws that Congress has enacted to - through the Department of Transportation to try to impose some protection for the public.</p><p>&#160;For example, there are laws that require strict compliance with drivers keeping accurate logs of their driving time, driving distances. There are limits on the amount of hours that they are allowed to drive in any particular period.&#160; Also there is enforcement by all the states to try to force compliance with that although we find that there is a lot of cheating that interstate trucking relies on speed and efficiency and sometimes drivers are overworked, underpaid, and the consequences are that they&#8217;re unsafe when they fall asleep or are spending way too many hours and losing concentration when they&#8217;re driving.</p><p>&#160;For instance there are specific areas of law that apply to trucking accidents that we don&#8217;t see in regular automobile collision cases. So there are certain laws, both federal and state laws that apply to certain types of cases and each of those have their unique characteristics.

aS'<p>How do I find out what prior claims my insurance company might rely upon in determining whether to issue me a policy or determine my insurance rates? Insurance companies go through an underwriting process, which includes reviewing past claims amongst other matters. &#160;To find out about prior claims, many carriers subscribe to a service known as A-PLUS (sometimes called ISO), which is a property and liability database designed for insurance underwriters. A-PLUS serves as a clearinghouse for claims data from many different insurance companies. &#160;The data shows the claims histories of individuals and properties. &#160;Participating insurers can search the database to find information for underwriting, to verify claims information provided by insurance applicants, and to help prevent fraud on applications for insurance. &#160; A-PLUS property reports provide up to five years of information on all types of loss, including: fire damage; flood damage; earthquake damage; burglary; credit card theft; workers compensation; and medical payments. &#160;To insure that the information being relied upon is accurate, you are entitled to full disclosure of any data regarding your own claims that may be in the A-PLUS database. &#160;ISO releases the information within 10 days of receiving a signed &quot;Request for Disclosure&quot; form. &#160;To obtain a copy of the form, or for more information, call 1-800-709-8842, or write to: &#160;A-PLUS Consumer Inquiry Center, ISO, 545 Washington Boulevard, 22nd Floor, Jersey City, NJ 07310-1686. &#160;The standard price for a loss-history report is $19.50. &#160;However, you can get a copy of your report free of charge if an insurer took an adverse action against you - for example, if an insurer denied coverage within the past 60 days - based on a report submitted to A-PLUS by a participating insurer. &#160;If you disagree with or dispute the accuracy of information in the A-PLUS database, A-PLUS will contact the insurer that submitted the claim and request an investigation. &#160;Pending the outcome of the investigation, it will add a statement of dispute to your claims record if you request it. &#160;If the insurer does not investigate the disputed claim within 30 days of notification, A-PLUS will delete the claim from the database. &#160;If, after investigation, the insurer stands by the claim and does not agree to remove it, you may submit a statement of dispute on that claims record. &#160;Your statement of dispute then becomes available as part of the A-PLUS report in any future inquiries by any insurer. &#160;For more information, go to <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iso.com" title="ISO">www.iso.com</a>.</p><p></p>'

aS'The White House recently released its Fiscal Year 2014 budget proposal, and there are many suggested changes that will impact individuals, businesses, and estates. Several of these proposals&#8212;particularly on the estate and gift tax side&#8212;have been made previously, and have failed to become law. It is also important to remember that the President&#8217;s budget proposal is, essentially, a wish list that requires Congressional cooperation. Nonetheless, the budget proposal provides insight into what current tax breaks are at least being considered for limitation or elimination.\r\n\r\nOn the individual tax front, the most significant proposal would limit the value of itemized deductions to 28% for taxpayers in the higher tax brackets. The alternative minimum tax currently provides a certain limitation of deductions, but this proposal would extend beyond the limitations currently in place via the alternative minimum tax. Additionally, the so-called &#8220;Buffett Rule&#8221; would require the highest earners to pay no less than 30% of their income in taxes. One final proposal of interest would prohibit individuals from accumulating more than $3 million in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. These budget proposals represent a continuation of some of the themes that the White House pursued during the &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; negotiations of late 2012.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the budget proposal items relating to estate and gift tax have been targeted in prior years, but have failed to gain momentum. For example, the 2014 budget proposal seeks to place significant limits on grantor-retained annuity trusts, a tried-and-true estate planning technique that has provided benefits to many families to date. The proposal also seeks to limit the extent to which families may benefit from &#8220;dynasty trusts&#8221; that can now provide lasting benefits to generation after generation. Most importantly, the budget proposal seeks to return the estate and gift tax exemptions and tax rates to 2009 levels. The current $5.25 million unified estate and gift tax exemption would revert to a $3.5 million estate tax threshold and a $1 million gift tax threshold. The tax rate would increase from 40% to 45%. In real terms, this change would subject to onerous taxes a substantial number of families who are currently exempt.\r\n\r\nThe White House&#8217;s 2014 budget proposal is a long way from becoming reality, but it is worth noting that there is little in the proposal that seeks to reduce taxes. To the extent that any of these proposals becomes law, it will be more important than ever to seek professional advice to properly respond to the changes. If you would like to discuss any of these matters, please call Les Williams at 410-783-6403.<!--more-->The White House recently released its Fiscal Year 2014 budget proposal, and there are many suggested changes that will impact individuals, businesses, and estates.

aS"<em> </em>There is good news for personal injury victims in the state of Texas.&#160; Previously, if a person injured by another person's negligence or other wrongful conduct obtained medical treatment which their medical insurance company paid for, the insurance company could insert, and then enforce, a provision in the injured plaintiff's medical policy which permitted the carrier to be repaid all of the money that was paid by the company as a result of the third party's negligence or other wrongful conduct, even if that meant that the insurance company received all of the money being paid to the plaintiff.&#160; The resulting tragedy was quickly exposed when persons suffering catastrophic injuries wound up receiving nothing, with everything instead going to the medical insurance company.&#160; In HB 1869, know as the Subrogation Reform Bill, and bring codified in Chapter 140 of the Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code, the Texas Legislature recently overturned the Texas Supreme Court's decision in <em>Fortis v. Cantu, </em>and now caps amount of money that the medical insurance company can be repaid in instances where the injured person is not able to realize a complete and adequate recovery for an injury sustained by the negligence or other wrongful conduct of another person.&#160; The amounts differ depending on the circumstances; however, if you are represented by an attorney, then, effective January 1, 2014, the insurance company can only take up to 1/3 of the total recovery to satisfy any amounts that it paid out.&#160; If the injured party is not represented by an attorney, the amount goes up to half.&#160; (Unfortunately, however, HB 1869 does not apply to Medicare , Medicaid, CHIPS, Worker's Compensation, and self-funded ERISA plans).&#160; If you have suffered a personal injury in the Metroplex, including Denton County, Dallas County or Tarrant County, as a result of tortious conduct, including negligence, products liability, automobile accident, 18 wheeler accident, medical malpractice, or other wrongful conduct, then please contact me so we can further discuss your legal rights during a free consultation.&#160;"

aS'<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; "><b>Migraine headaches are torture</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">By Laura Casey<br />\r\nContra Costa Times </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">The pain is most often described as\r\nMedieval torture. When a migraine headache sufferer has an attack, it feels\r\nlike his or her head is being crushed in a vice. Some feel like they\'re being\r\nhit in the forehead with a sledgehammer, others like their heads are being\r\npounded by nails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">&quot;It is not something you wish\r\non your worst enemy,&quot; says Eileen Jones, a registered nurse who has\r\nsuffered from migraines for nearly 25 years. Jones, who faces chronic daily\r\nmigraines, says that since she started getting the headaches at age 36, her\r\nwhole world has shrunk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">&quot;I tried to do whatever I like\r\nto do with my life,&quot; says Jones, a Piedmont resident. &quot;But the pain\r\nis the parent saying, \'No, you can\'t.\' &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">A migraine is not the kind of\r\nheadache most of us associate with a hangover or a stressful day. A universal\r\ncondition -- there are migraine sufferers in every culture and every country --\r\nthe notorious headaches affect nearly one in five women and one in 20 men, the\r\nNational Headache Foundation says. Some migraine suffers, such as Jones, can\r\nget debilitating headaches every day, while others much less frequently and\r\nless severely. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">The impact of migraines surfaced\r\nlast month when it was revealed that presidential candidate Rep. Michele\r\nBachmann (R-Minn.) is among the nearly 30 million Americans who suffer from\r\nthem. While some question whether a migraine sufferer can stand up to the job\r\nas president, each person\'s ability to deal with migraines depends on many\r\nfactors, including how well they respond to drugs and other treatment. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">One thing is certain, however --\r\nwhile new treatments continue to be tried, some with good results, there is no\r\nmagic bullet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">Range of triggers</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">Migraines often come with a number\r\nof symptoms beyond throbbing head pain, says Dr. Kenneth Peters of the Northern\r\nCalifornia Headache Clinic in Mountain View. They are also associated with\r\nnausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound. Their beginnings can be\r\ndramatic: About 15 percent of people who suffer from them experience an &quot;aura&quot;\r\n-- flashing lights or having a decreased area of vision -- shortly before they\r\nbegin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">They can be triggered by stress,\r\nsounds, smells and foods, but often, they\'re triggered by nothing. Movement or\r\nexercise often exacerbates the pain, and many say the only way to cope is to\r\nlie down in a dark room. The pain usually lasts anywhere from four to 72 hours\r\nand is exhausting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">A 2008 migraine survey by\r\nHarrisInteractive and Pfizer revealed that of the 3,000 American migraine\r\nsufferers polled, 66 percent say they tough out the pain and continue their\r\nworkdays, but they also averaged losing about four days of work a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">&quot;Most migraines are very\r\ndisabling,&quot; Peters says. &quot;We see patients on work disability; they\r\ncan\'t function.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">He added that for some, daily headaches\r\nmake it impossible to work. Others can\'t plan their family life because it\'s\r\nvery difficult to do anything with the family when they are having a migraine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">Jones, for example, was heartbroken\r\nto miss the rehearsal dinner for her son\'s wedding. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">&quot;I can\'t keep promises to\r\npeople,&quot; Jones says. &quot;That\'s the hardest part.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">Migraine sufferers typically get\r\ntheir first headaches in their late teens, or early 20s and 30s, Peters says.\r\nWoman are affected more often than men likely because of the &quot;estrogen\r\neffect,&quot; Peters says. It\'s not uncommon for a woman to experience\r\nmigraines during monthly menstrual periods. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">Dr. Alfred Scopp, a psychologist and\r\nco-founder of the Northern California Headache Clinic, says the level of\r\ndisability during a migraine attack can be equivalent to Stage 4 cancer or\r\nAIDS. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">&quot;With any recurring pain\r\ncondition or disabling condition, no one can imagine what it is like except the\r\nperson with that condition,&quot; Scopp says. &quot;I can\'t imagine what it is\r\nlike to be a diabetic. We can\'t really imagine the unpredictably or the fear\r\nthat you might have a bad headache. It\'s just the way it is.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">Taking away life</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">Jones abandoned her nursing career\r\nand learned to live with a certain amount of pain every day. She says she\'s\r\ntried everything to ease her agony, including checking into a one-month\r\ninpatient hospital program and having a occipital nerve stimulator implanted in\r\nher head -- its battery pack is visible on her chest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">She stays busy volunteering for the\r\nRed Cross and by organizing a Miles for Migraine annual walk and run in\r\nOctober, which raised $10,000 for migraine research last year. She also travels\r\nwith a group of medical professionals to Washington, D.C., every year to ask\r\npoliticians to support headache research. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">Medicine has proved effective for\r\nAnna Soskin, 17, who is under the care of doctors at the UC San Francisco\r\nHeadache Center. Although she still has to deal with about three headaches a\r\nday that last about an hour each, that\'s better than a relentless all-day\r\nheadache. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">Still, she struggles. The Alameda\r\nresident has missed so much school she has to attend an extra year. She wants\r\nto go to college and land a great job but worries her headaches will keep her\r\non her parents\' couch through adulthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">&quot;There are times when it gets\r\npretty scary,&quot; she says. &quot;The doctors don\'t seem to be freaking out\r\nabout it, and they are trying to help me. So I am trying not to freak out about\r\nit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">Livermore resident Marianne Portman\r\nbegan treating her migraine with holistic methods that included making changes\r\nin her diet and drinking a lot of water. Doctors such as Scopp also work with\r\npatients on nonmedicinal treatments such as learning how to maintain healthy\r\nlevels of stress and participating in cognitive behavioral therapy and\r\nbiofeedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">Although Portman still gets\r\nmigraines once every 10 days or so and they can last more than a day, she\r\nmaintains a sales job at a Pleasanton furniture store. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">&quot;I think there are many times\r\nthat it affects life tremendously,&quot; she says. &quot;I pray that the day I\r\nget my migraine is the day I have off work.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">She has considered going on\r\npermanent disability because of the frequency of the pain and the anguish she\r\nfeels. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">Hope for workers</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">While Bachmann has kept her\r\ntreatment private, neurologist Jerome Goldstein, director of the San Francisco\r\nHeadache Clinic, says there\'s no reason to believe her condition would affect\r\nher ability to do her job. Many people who suffer from migraine headaches hold\r\npositions of responsibility and power, he says, including airline pilots and\r\ndoctors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">&quot;It\'s variable from person to\r\nperson, but I can say the vast majority of people we see at the San Francisco\r\nHeadache Clinic are very active, working and enjoying life,&quot; says\r\nGoldstein who recently was named president of the Headache and Facial Pain\r\nSection of the American Academy of Neurology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">He points out that medications are\r\ngetting better and treatments are tailored to each patient. Some medications\r\ncan relieve a migraine within 20 minutes, depending on the type of headache the\r\nperson is suffering, and more are coming to market. Even Botox recently has\r\nbeen approved by the FDA to relieve pain for some migraine patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" line-height: normal; ">&quot;Most migraine headache\r\nsufferers can be helped,&quot; Goldstein adds, &quot;and can lead beautiful,\r\nnormal, complete and functional lives.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.shea-shea.com/">Shea\r\n&amp; Shea</a> is a nationally recognized personal injury law firm located in\r\nSan Jose, California.&#160; The firm has extensive experience in representing\r\nindividuals and their families in cases involving <a href="http://www.shea-shea.com/Catastrophic-Injury.aspx">catastrophic injuries</a>\r\nincluding <a href="http://www.shea-shea.com/Catastrophic-Injury/Wrongful-Death.aspx">wrongful\r\ndeath</a> and <a href="http://braininjury.shea-shea.com/">traumatic brain\r\ninjury</a>.&#160; Since 1966, Shea &amp; Shea have successfully represented the\r\nseriously injured and their families in both state and federal\r\ncourts.&#160;&#160; To learn more, visit us at <a href="http://www.shea-shea.com/">www.Shea-Shea.com</a> or telephone\r\n888-989-SHEA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>'

aS'Colorado law requires every driver in the state to have a minimum amount of auto insurance &#8211; $25,000 to cover damage and injuries to another individual and their vehicle, and a total of $50,000 to cover damage and injuries to all other vehicles and persons involved in the car accident.<br /><br />That&#8217;s pretty straightforward.

With the weather so nice out a lot more people would be \r\noutside doing activities or either just simply taking a stroll. Whenever\r\n the weather is this beautiful people usually don\'t like being inside.</p><p>Costa\r\n Mesa, California is the place to take a stroll too. With one of the \r\nlargest populations for a city in Orange County, CM is home to the \r\nOrange County Fairgrounds, South Coast Plaza Shopping mall, and it \r\nborders Huntington and Newport Beach, CA. Close enough to the beach, yet\r\n far enough away from the college kids on Balboa Island to raise a \r\nfamily and attend Calvary Chapel. A great city to raise kids, also means\r\n more teen drivers on probationary licenses, and children chasing balls \r\ninto the street, or running behind ice cream trucks. A young motorcycle \r\nrider, or bicyclist just would not have the driving experience to avoid \r\nsome accidents that an older driver could easily avoid.</p><p>In Costa \r\nMesa roads might be dangerous for motor vehicle drivers and you should \r\nreally pay attention to all that is going on but keep everything within \r\nbalance. Families also use this time to do special events together, and \r\nso there might be little kids running around. In Costa Mesa roads might \r\nbe dangerous for motor vehicle drivers because of everything taking \r\nplace, along with the pedestrian crossing the street to go to the beach.\r\n You can be driving and easily get distracted by looking at the people, \r\nor either something that might be going on.</p><p>A few seconds later \r\nyou hear this terrible sound and the car starts spinning out of control.\r\n Stopping it becomes impossible, and before you know it the car slams \r\ninto another vehicle. You hear people crying, and screaming. Others have\r\n been hurt, and then you find yourself bleeding. This turns out to be a \r\nvery tragic event because of the injuries that happened and the damage \r\nmade to both of the vehicles. All of a sudden, you have a spinal cord \r\ninjury, brain injury, or friction burn due to a car accident, or other \r\nmotor vehicle collision.</p><p>If you live in the Costa Mesa area, and \r\ncould either be responsible for the accident, or possibly be a victim \r\nthen you should start looking at the various consumer legal services \r\nthat would help you out during this time. The Costa Mesa area has Costa \r\nMesa personal injury attorneys and the attorney would be skilled, and \r\ntrained to handle these kinds of accidents and licensed through the \r\nCalifornia State Bar. Being responsible for an accident, or the victim\'s\r\n injuries is still something that could be painful for both parties. You\r\n will need help and guidance in knowing what to do next.

In order for the plan to work, the debtor must\r\nmake regular payments to the bankruptcy trustee. If the debtor can&#8217;t make the\r\npayments under the plan, the court may dismiss the case, or convert it to a\r\nChapter 7 bankruptcy, which is a discharge. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">In some cases, the debtor may not be able to complete the\r\nplan through no fault of his own.

This vague\r\naccount of one instance was the only information the&#160;Police gave for\r\ndecided to open an investigation into our client. The investigation consisted\r\nof doing trash-pulls of our clients abandoned garbage to search for drugs or\r\nparaphernalia. This investigation lasted approximately 2 months with 7\r\ndifferent trash pulls. During the first 4 weeks, every trash pull came up\r\nnegative for drugs or paraphernalia. However, the&#160;Police Department\r\ndeemed it necessary to continue this investigation, even though valuable\r\nresources were being utilized on a cold case at the expense of taxpayers.

aS'<p text-align: left;">In conversations with clients, it seems \r\nthat people misuse the terms &#8220;mediation&#8221; and &#8220;arbitration&#8221; more than \r\nmost other legal terms. Although I do not have any empirical data, my \r\neducated guess is that many businesses and construction contractors (who\r\n did not depend upon advice given by an experienced business attorney) \r\ninsert &#8220;arbitration&#8221; clauses into their contracts thinking that they \r\nmean &#8220;mediation.&#8221; Some transactions involving the sale of real estate \r\ninclude an arbitration clause. Countless times, clients involved in a \r\npotential lawsuit point to the &#8220;arbitration&#8221; clause, and are \r\ndisheartened when I explain to them the arbitration process. Many \r\nthought they were avoiding the potential high costs of litigation. These\r\n terms are NOT interchangeable and in this blog post I will explain the \r\nbasic differences between them.</p>\r\n<p>In mediation, <a target="&#95;self" href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/courtadmin/aoc/djs/programs/drs/mediation/home.html">an independent third party mediator</a>\r\n helps the parties negotiate a resolution. Just like in negotiations, \r\nyou control the outcome: neither a mediator nor your lawyer can \r\nnegotiate a resolution without your authorization. A mediator helps \r\nfacilitate the negotiation, but cannot make decisions or rulings on your\r\n case. Our attorneys have extensive experience in mediation. We see \r\nmediation as a cost-effective way to reach a settlement agreement and \r\navoid more expensive litigation when initial attempts at negotiation \r\nhave not been successful. Most importantly, you have some control over \r\nthe outcome.</p>\r\n<p>Conversely, arbitrations are conducted like regular trials, with a \r\njudge-like arbitrator (or multiple arbitrators) making a final decision \r\nbased upon the evidence presented, and hopefully the law of your \r\njurisdiction. Appeals of an arbitrator&#8217;s decision are virtually \r\nnonexistent. Because parties choose arbitration to avoid a court trial, \r\nthe <a target="&#95;self" href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opnscvwp/1061317.pdf">Virginia Supreme Court generally upholds</a>\r\n the arbitrator&#8217;s award, unless the arbitration process was faulty. In \r\nan arbitration, like trial, you have virtually no control over the \r\noutcome.</p>\r\n<p>Here is a helpful chart showing the differences and similarities between trials, arbitration and mediation:</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://blog.tarleyrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ADR-chart.pdf">ADR chart</a></p>\r\n<p>Mediation is an excellent alternative to filing a lawsuit or even \r\nresolving pending litigation. Arbitration can be an effective \r\nalternative way to resolve disputes, however the process is similar to a\r\n court trial, just slightly less formal. However, before binding \r\nyourself to any form of alternative dispute resolution, consult with \r\nyour <a target="&#95;self" href="http://www.tarleyrobinson.com/jtarley.html">experienced business litigation attorney</a>.</p>'

aS'<p class="MsoNormal">As I sat down to write this article, I received an email \r\nfrom FACDL member Brian Tannenbaum wherein he forwarded an article written by \r\nLarry Pozner in his 1999 President&#8217;s column for the NACDL &#8220;Champion&#8221; magazine \r\nentitled <u>Lessons Learned</u>. A few of the lessons that were set forth \r\nare:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&#8220;Of your ten greatest \r\nvictories, seven will be deals. Nobody will hear about the deals, but they count \r\njust as much.&#8221;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&#8220;Clients benefit from \r\nyour reputation. It&#8217;s not in their interest or yours to do anything \r\nquestionable, even if they think it is.&#8221;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&#8220;Your reputation for \r\nintegrity will win you more motions than will case \r\nlaw.&#8221;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">These lessons are universal and we are \r\nnever too experienced to be reminded of their \r\nimportance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When we took our oath as attorneys in the \r\nState of Florida, we agreed to be bound by the Rules of \r\nProfessional Conduct. The Preamble to the Rules of Professional Conduct sets \r\nforth, in part, that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">A lawyer, as a member of the legal \r\nprofession, is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system, and \r\na public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of \r\njustice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">As a representative of clients, a lawyer \r\nperforms various functions. <b>As an \r\nadviser,</b> a lawyer provides a client with a informed understanding of \r\nthe client&#8217;s legal rights and obligations and explains their practical \r\nimplications. <b>As an advocate,</b> a \r\nlawyer zealously asserts the client&#8217;s position under the rules of the adversary \r\nsystem. <b>As a negotiator,</b> a lawyer \r\nseeks a result advantageous to the client but consistent with requirements of \r\nhonest dealing with others. <b>As an \r\nevaluator,</b> a lawyer acts by examining a client&#8217;s legal affairs and \r\nreporting about them to the client or to others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Our obligations to our client as an \r\nadviser, advocate, negotiator and evaluator begin from the moment the client \r\ncalls or stops by the office for the initial interview. Many times, I fear, \r\ncounsel in DUI defense may be lacking one or more of these individual yet \r\ninterrelated roles we must play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">We all recognize that in order to obtain \r\nthe best possible resolution for our clients there is no substitute for \r\npreparation. Preparation is the benchmark for positive negotiation with opposing \r\ncounsel and the court and it is necessary for client management. Preparation is \r\nessential in establishing your reputation as an adviser, advocate, negotiator \r\nand evaluator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Preparation takes its form by being aware \r\nof the facts of your case, the law that applies and the connection to the \r\ncommunity in which you live. For example, even though we know that legally, the \r\nState has numerous hurdles to overcome in proving a DRE/urine screen case, we \r\nalso may realize that in a given community, the fear of cocaine being in \r\nsomeone&#8217;s system, is enough for a jury to convict the client of DUI. Within that \r\nsame community, a jury may very well acquit the Defendant facing a DRE \r\nprosecution for prescription medication. Knowledge of your community is \r\nessential to fulfilling your multiple roles as defense \r\nattorney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">The law gives you the tools necessary to \r\nserve your client and the interests of justice. Florida Statute section 316.193 \r\nsets forth the penalties for Driving Under the Influence. This may seem so \r\nbasic, but I challenge each reader to go to misdemeanor court and watch more \r\nthan just your case sometime and see the number of attorneys who are in the \r\ncourt representing a DUI defendant who have absolutely no idea as to what \r\nsection 316.193 actually holds. A proper utilization of those tools will benefit \r\nall. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">To illustrate this point I will point out \r\nthis example: I have heard many prosecutors represent to the court that a person \r\nconvicted of DUI must be placed on probation for a minimum of six (6) months. \r\nThat is completely incorrect. There is nothing in the statute that states a \r\nminimum time period of probation that must be ordered on a DUI conviction. \r\nSubsections (5) and (6) of 316.193 simply reads:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><b>(5)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The court shall place all \r\noffenders convicted of violating this section on monthly reporting probation \r\n&#8230;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><b>(6)(a) For a first conviction, the \r\ncourt shall place the defendant on probation for a period not to exceed 1 year \r\n&#8230;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Simply put, there is no requirement of a \r\nminimum period of monthly reporting probation that may be ordered by the \r\ncourt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">If defense counsel, as <b>adviser</b> alerts the client early on in the \r\ncase as to the potential consequences faced by a DUI conviction and then also \r\nfairly <b>evaluates</b> the case for the \r\nclient with attention to the facts, law and circumstances surrounding the \r\nrepresentation, many of the terms that will be ordered can be completed before \r\nthe plea and sentencing in the case. This in turn, could lead to a much shorter \r\nperiod of probation.&#160; </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">In the practice of DUI defense, we have all \r\nbeen faced with the situation where our case really cannot go to trial for one \r\nreason or another. It may be that the evidence of guilt is overwhelming or that \r\nthe client just does not want to take the risk of trial for fear of a more \r\nenhanced sentence. Whatever the situation, we realize that in a majority of \r\ncases, the resolution will be brought about by plea \r\nnegotiations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">It also seems like there are more and more \r\nclients coming to us now that are facing their second, third or fourth DUIs. \r\nMany of these clients are coming in to see us recognizing that they have a \r\nsubstance abuse problem. We have an obligation to our clients to view them as \r\npeople who need our advice as much in helping them deal with their illness as in \r\nhelping them with the legal dilemma they find themselves in. I propose that \r\nthese two goals are not mutually exclusive and that we are doing a tremendous \r\nservice to the client to assist them with immediate counseling services before a \r\ncourt mandates it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">While the vast majority of our clients do \r\nnot need residential substance abuse treatment when they come to see us for a \r\nfirst DUI offense, counsel may need to consider recommending entry into DUI \r\nschool and its substance abuse evaluation process. I do not always recommend \r\nenrolling in DUI school immediately because if the defense has a good case for \r\ntrial, AND it appears that the Formal Review may be won, the client may not want \r\nto enroll in DUI school so it will not appear on an otherwise clean Motor \r\nVehicle Record.&#160; However, if the chances for success at the Formal Review or \r\ntrial seem slim or you have a client that has given you the indication that he \r\nor she will not go to trial, then a recommendation for DUI school at this early \r\nstage may be appropriate. This is where the attorney&#8217;s skills as case <b>evaluator</b> become so \r\nimportant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">There are times however, that we know from \r\nthe initial interview that a client is looking at jail time for a given DUI \r\noffense. Maybe it is because of prior DUI offenses, or because of the gravity of \r\na particular driving pattern or accident; but we know the State and the Court \r\nwill be wanting more than the minimums upon conviction and incarceration is on \r\nthe horizon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Florida Statute, section 316.193(6)(k) was \r\nwritten with this client in mind:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><b>(6)(k) A defendant, in the court&#8217;s \r\ndiscretion, may be required to serve all or any portion of a term of \r\nimprisonment to which the defendant has been sentenced pursuant to this section \r\nin a residential alcoholism treatment program or a residential drug abuse \r\ntreatment program. Any time spent in such a program must be credited by the \r\ncourt toward the term of imprisonment.</b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">It is in that vein that I thought of \r\nputting together a short source list for those attorneys pressed for time or \r\nideas on residential treatment programs that may be necessary to convince the \r\nAssistant State Attorney or, more importantly, the judge to forego a substantial \r\nperiod of jail for our clients. <b>This list is \r\nNOT exclusive! </b>There are definitely more programs in the state, but \r\nthis might give you a start.

Any action or failure to act in violation of a law commanding or forbidding it is classified a &#8220;crime&#8221;. A crime is defined as conduct that threatens, harms or endangers the safety of people and is split into four major sub-categories: fatal offenses, personal offenses, property offenses and participatory offenses.</p><p>Fatal offenses typically revolve around homicide and manslaughter, while personal offenses deal with instances of assault and battery, rape and sexual abuse. Property offenses in Argentina include breaking and entering, burglary and theft. Aiding in a criminal act would result in a participatory offense.</p><p>In Criminal Defense Law, the suit is initiated by the province or federal government through a prosecutor rather than being initiated by the victim. Plaintiffs in a civil law suit only need to show by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant is liable (responsible) for the damages. But, the prosecutor in a criminal defense law case has to prove to the judge &#8220;beyond a reasonable doubt&#8221; that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged.</p><p><strong>Kier Joffe Law Offices&#160;The Buenos Aires Criminal Lawyer Source</strong></p><p>The Buenos Aires criminal lawyer professionals of Kier Joffe Law Offices law firm are distinguished by a history of successful criminal law claim recoveries and resolutions.

aS'Here&#8217;s a rule of thumb you can take to the bank: If an insurance company tells you that you don&#8217;t need a lawyer &#8211; <i>you need a lawyer!</i><br /><br />It&#8217;s one of the Top Five favorite tricks of an insurance company. If you&#8217;ve been hurt in an auto accident Colorado, a week or so after the accident the at-fault party&#8217;s insurance company will give you a call. The friendly adjuster will ask how you&#8217;re doing and commiserate with you about your situation. They&#8217;ll ask you a few innocent sounding questions about what happened. Then they&#8217;ll suggest that to take care of you and make all this go away so you can get back to your life, they&#8217;ll send you a check. Don&#8217;t bother with a lawyer, they&#8217;ll say. A lawyer will just slow everything down and hold up you getting your money.<br /><br />If you fall for their smooth line, you&#8217;ll lose &#8211; big time. Here&#8217;s why.<br /><br />American Medical Association guidelines suggest that a patient who has been injured should be seen regularly and an evaluation of their injuries and the possibility of permanent impairment not be made until six months or more have gone by. Once the doctor has a better idea of your injuries and the care you will need now and in the future, you will be in a better position to negotiate a settlement with the insurance company for the money you deserve.<br /><br />Of course, insurance companies know this. To avoid having to pay out what you really deserve, they&#8217;d rather get to you early and convince you to settle for a tiny little check instead. That&#8217;s much better for the bottom line, after all &#8211; the insurer&#8217;s, not yours.<br /><br />Which is why you need an attorney from the Law Offices of Dianne Sawaya to fight for your rights.

aS'Interesting article by Mike Masnick of TechDirt:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nRIAA Lawyers Trying To Rewrite History Of Copyright Clause Through Shoddy Scholarship And Selective Quotation\r\n\r\nfrom the <i>must-pay-well</i> dept\r\nOver\r\n the last week or so, I\'ve seen a number of folks in the usual crowd of \r\ncopyright maximalists cheering on a new &quot;paper&quot; put forth by a group \r\nhilariously calling itself the Center for Individual Freedom, supposedly\r\n trying to <a href="http://cfif.org/v/index.php/press-room/1681-cfif-publishes-new-policy-paper-the-constitutional-and-historical-foundations-of-copyright-protection">establish the &quot;constitutional and historical foundations of copyright protection.&quot;</a>\r\n  The &quot;paper&quot; (and I use that term loosely) itself does no such thing.  \r\nIt\'s a one-sided polemic about why copyright is property -- argued by \r\nselectively quoting a few historical claims, often out of context, and \r\nignoring everything else.  The six page document (quick read) was \r\nactually written by three lawyers... who admit that they work for the \r\nRIAA.  The basic argument is that copyright is a &quot;natural right,&quot; and \r\nthat this idea was well established at the time of the Constitution.  \r\nThe framing, then, is that all the Constitution was really doing was \r\ncodifying a natural right that all agreed was akin to property, and that\r\n this right cannot and should not be diminished or taken away.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTo do this, the authors rely, almost exclusively, on some arguments that\r\n John Locke made.  This is the go to move of copyright maximalists.  \r\nBecause John Locke argued that property rights were established as a \r\nresult of one\'s labor, and thus a &quot;natural right&quot;, and some of the \r\nfounders were influenced by John Locke, voila, copyright was meant to be\r\n given as a natural right.  As the paper notes:\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>\r\nThe foundational premise of Locke\'s theory\r\nis that all people have a natural right of property\r\nin their own bodies. Because people own\r\ntheir bodies, Locke reasoned that they also\r\nowned the labor of their bodies and, by extension, the fruits of that \r\nlabor.\r\nWhen an individual catches a fish in a stream, he has a\r\nright to keep that fish because but-for his efforts,\r\nthe fish would not have been caught. For the\r\nsame reason, an author has a right to his works\r\nbecause his efforts made the work possible. Under Locke&#8217;s view, &quot;[o]ur\r\nhandiwork becomes our property because our hands&#8212;and the energy, \r\nconsciousness, and control that fuel their labor--are our property.&quot;\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThat is, &quot;a\r\nperson rightly claims ownership in her works to the extent that her \r\nlabor\r\nresulted in their existence.&quot; If anything, under Locke\'s theory, \r\nintellectual property should be even\r\nmore worthy of protection than physical property. Land and natural\r\nresources are pre-existing and finite, and one person\'s acquisition of a\r\n piece\r\nof tangible property may reduce the &quot;common&quot; that is available to \r\nothers.\r\nNot so with tangible expressions: the field of creative works is \r\ninfinite, and\r\none person\'s expression of an idea does not meaningfully deplete the \r\nopportunities available to others; indeed, it expands the size of the \r\n&quot;pie&quot; by\r\nproviding inspiration to others. Moreover, while tangible property such \r\nas\r\nland and chattel is often pre-existing and acquired through mere \r\nhappenstance of birth, intellectual property flows directly from its \r\ncreator and is\r\nessentially the &quot;propertization of talent&quot;--that is, &quot;a reward, an \r\nempowering\r\ninstrument, for the talented upstarts&quot; in a society.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nNearly all of this is misleading or out of context.  Or just wrong.....<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121219/03043121434/riaa-lawyers-trying-to-rewrite-history-copyright-clause-through-shoddy-scholarship-selective-quotation.shtml">Complete article </a><!--more-->According to TechDirt, an organization which is fronting for the RIAA has published a shoddy article rewriting copyright history'

aS'The primary reasons why most travelers would opt to ride the rail cross country rather than take a plane, car or bus are safety and comfort. A train ride is supposed to be a safe and enjoyable way to travel. However, as secure as trains may seem, train accidents do happen. A train accident is a ghastly occurrence that usually results in brutal endings. The atrocious outcome of a train crash is the very reason the term &quot;train wreck&quot; has become a colloquialism for disaster.<br /><br />According to the U.S. Department of Transportation there were 13,352 train accidents in the U.S. in 2006. 910 people were killed while 8,349 were injured. In result to these deaths and injuries, many personal injury cases for passengers and families of the deceased and injured were filed. However, there are other people involved in the accident that were injured who were not on board the train during the accident. In addition to passengers, non-passengers are also injured by train accidents&#8212;these people have legal options. <br /><br />Furthermore, most of the total 5,800 wrecks nationwide that involve a vehicle-train collision occur at railroad crossings. These types of accidents kill 600 people and injure about 2,300. Over 50% of all railroad fatal accidents occur at crossings with passive or inadequate safety devices. Some railroad crossings have no safety devices whatsoever!<br /><br />It is impossible for a moving train, with momentum to come to a full stop within seconds. A 150-car train traveling at an average speed of 50 miles-per-hour will take over a mile to completely stop.&#160; While it is easy for a person to assume he or she is at fault, should have known better or seen the tracks, it is the fault of unprotected crossings. In the majority of rail crashes and train disasters, people are injured and lose their automobiles because of unprotected crossings or inadequate warning signs. The of the Federal Railroad Administration, states that over half of all railroad crossing accidents occur at exposed crossings. Moreover, 80% of all of these crossings do not have clear and adequate warning signage and gates.<br /><br />The Federal Railroad Administration has set specific laws regarding high speed trains. For trains traveling less than 110 miles-per-hour, grade crossings are permitted. Both the state and railroad company must cooperate to determine the best warning device for passersby and motorists to ensure maximum safety. These warning devices might include cross bucks, lights or two quadrant gates. For trains traveling at a speed of 110-125 miles-per-house crossing is only allowed if there is an &quot;impenetrable barrier&quot; that physically blocks traffic whenever the train comes by. Finally, crossings are not permitted for trains traveling at a speed faster than 125 miles-per-hour because of the possibility of vehicle accidents is too great.<br /><br />Obviously frivolous behavior, such as people playing around railroad tracks when there are clear warnings posted would not qualify as grounds for a vehicle accident lawsuit. However, if a person was not aware of a railroad danger because of inadequate warnings, and were consequently injured or killed because of a train, there could be liability involved. After all, sounds can be distorted or hushed and the &quot;appearance&quot; of a train coming from a distance is not always perceivable to the average person-unless there are adequate warnings in accordance with FRA.<br /><br />If you or a family member has been injured due to a train accident or railroad crossing accident then contact The Rasansky Law Firm. Contact 1-800-ATTORNEY to get a free consultation from a train accident attorney on your case. You may be entitled to medical bills and pain and suffering damages, so call now!<!--more-->The primary reasons why most travelers would opt to ride the rail cross\r\ncountry rather than take a plane, car or bus are safety and comfort.

aS'<p>If two competing businesses reach a demarcation agreement on the marketing of their products, this is in principle valid for an indefinite period of time.</p><p>GRP Rainer Lawyers and Tax Advisors in Cologne, Berlin, Bonn, Bremen, Dusseldorf, Essen, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich, Nuremberg, Stuttgart and London www.grprainer.com/en conclude: The Regional Court of Braunschweig had to rule on a case (Az.: 9 O 2637/12) concerning a demarcation agreement between two spirits producers. The two firms reached an agreement in 1974 that regulated which producer could use which colours in marketing their products. The claimant terminated the contract in 2009, pointing out that the market conditions had changed in the intervening years. It had since become associated with the colour green and not the defendant. This was also supported by the fact that the defendant announced declining sales figures. This change in the market provided the grounds for termination.<br /><br />The Court did not agree with the claimant&#8217;s view and rejected the complaint, there being no evident grounds for termination. The demarcation agreement from the 70s did not contain any rule that provided for an ordinary right of termination. A change in market conditions, as was plead by the claimant, had not occurred in the view of the judges, which is why an extraordinary termination was ruled out. Such a demarcation agreement is valid for an indefinite period and must still be observed even after 30 years. Moreover, the colour green continues in fact to be very important for the marketing of the defendant&#8217;s products.<br /><br />The judges went on to clarify that it was not unreasonable for the claimant to have to continue adhering to the agreement. It was not forbidden to use the colour green on a small scale. Furthermore, the agreement had not hitherto hindered the claimant&#8217;s economic success. Similarly, no cartel law aspects were present which would have established that the agreement was impermissible.<br /><br />The diversity of trademark law sometimes presents businesses concerned with legal problems. Here, the appearance on the market and the product&#8217;s connection with certain symbols and colours play an important role in economic success. In order to avoid infringing any existing rights, one should draw on the help of a lawyer active in the field or trademark law. In the case of trademark breaches and the enforcement of possible claims, he can support you in a consultative capacity.<br /><br />http://www.grprainer.com/en/Trademark-Law.html</p>'

aS'<p>While marriage represents an emotional bond, from a practical standpoint dealing with finances is also part of married life. Many people regard a prenuptial agreement with distain, believing it is a precursor to certain divorce.

aS'Do you owe the government taxes?<div class="entry clear">\r\n                <p>Do you owe the government taxes? Are you being <strong>audited by the Internal Revenue Services</strong>?\r\n Are you being accused of committing tax crime? If you answer \r\naffirmatively in one or more of the aforementioned queries, then you \r\ncertainly needed the services of a tax attorney.\r\n How can you be certain that you need tax attorney&#8217;s services? Well, you\r\n have to consider several things. First, if you think that the tax \r\nproblem will not complicate things if ignored then; the answer is on the\r\n negative. However, if it will worsen when ignored, better get yourself \r\nan attorney before it&#8217;s too late to do so. You might be subject to \r\npenalties or worst imprisonment. Tax penalties include <strong>fines, liens, levies, interests, and other penalties</strong>. Moreover, in criminal cases failure to pay tax or employing tax fraud can put the taxpayer to jail.</p>\r\n<p>So, you have decided to hire the services of a tax attorney. How are you to choose the right one?</p>\r\n<p>Remember that attorneys may either have a field of specialization or \r\nopt to become a general practitioner. Moreover, in choosing a tax \r\nattorney, be sure that he is an expert on taxation. However, it should \r\nnot end there. Also consider his reputation and past records in \r\ndefending his clients. Be sure that he is of good standing in that \r\nparticular field of law.</p>\r\n<p>Also consider the attorney&#8217;s fees. As you know, legal services are \r\nnot cheap. In fact, if you insist to remedy your tax trouble yourself, \r\nthe cost might multiply. Attorney&#8217;s fees may vary according to place, \r\nachievements, and the like. Hence, before you ponder on other \r\nconsiderations, think of this aspect first. You might get frustrated if \r\nyou have chosen an ideal lawyer yet; cannot afford his legal services.</p>\r\n<p>Talk to several tax attorneys. Ask them about their fee arrangements.\r\n To help you further, here are the common fee arrangements of tax attorneys:</p>\r\n<p>1. Flat or Fixed Rate. This arrangement covers a set of fees for a particular legal service.</p>\r\n<p>2. Hourly Rate. The fee is based on the time spent by the lawyer on your legal problem.</p>\r\n<p>3. Contingent Fee. The fee is dependent on the amount of recovery \r\nsecured by the lawyer. A fixed percentage of which will serve as \r\nattorney&#8217;s fees. Nevertheless, you will still be responsible for \r\nparticular expenses like filing fees, court costs, telephone charges, \r\ncopies, and more.</p>\r\n<p>Another factor to consider is time. Time is one essential factor in \r\ntax problems. Time is always of the essence. Penalties will accumulate \r\nif your tax burden is not remedied at the earliest possible time. \r\nFurther, you may also lose your chance to appeal, if you let the grace \r\nperiod lapse.</p>\r\n<p>You should also consider your personal preferences in choosing a <a href="http://www.floridataxlawyers.com" target="&#95;blank">tax attorney</a>.\r\n Do you prefer seasoned lawyers? How about the gender? The personality \r\nof the lawyer must also be taken into consideration. He must be easy to \r\ntalk with and confide to. This is because sensitive and confidential \r\nmatters must be communicated to a tax lawyer so that he can give you the\r\n appropriate legal measures to apply. If some things regarding tax \r\nburdens are hidden from him, it will redound to the disadvantage of the \r\nclient. All these factors must be contemplated to choose a lawyer that \r\ncan work with you efficiently. In the end, it is essential to pick \r\nsomeone whom you can trust to do the best possible legal remedy for you.</p>\r\n                      </div><!--more-->Do you owe the government taxes?

Ferguson now of the Matthew C.\r\nFerguson Law Firm, Aspen, Colorado successfully argued for Colorado Supreme\r\nCourt reversal of the Colorado Court of Appeals finding of bid rigging by\r\nattendees at a foreclosure sale in Pitkin County, Florida. Aspen Attorney Matt\r\nFerguson won the case at the trial level proving that the members of an LLC\r\nformed after the Public Trustee foreclosure sale by 3 bidders had not bid\r\nrigged. Ferguson represented the LLC that was deemed by the Pitkin County\r\nPublic Trustee to have been the successful high bidder at the 2007 foreclosure\r\nsale in Pitkin County. The Property Owner launched a series of challenges to\r\nthe foreclosure sale against the Pitkin County Public Trustee, the foreclosing bank\r\nand then Ferguson\'s client. Ferguson defended all those proceedings in the\r\nPitkin County, District Court. The bank also retained counsel and the issue of\r\nstrict compliance was also decided in favor of the bank by the Supreme Court.\r\nAmos\' technical notice compliance arguments were rejected by the Colorado\r\nSupreme Court, which found that the Property owner had indeed received timely\r\nnotice of the foreclosure sale and her redemption rights. The Court would not\r\nexpand its strict compliance holding in <i>Dews v. District Court, 648 P.2d\r\n662, 664 (Colo. 1982).</i> Rather the Court noted as pointed at by Aspen Lawyer\r\nFerguson at trial and thus in the appellate record that Amos and her attorneys\r\nhad the requisite Rule 120 notice of sale but chose not to challenge the pending\r\nforeclosure. Aspen lawyer Matt Ferguson helped defend the notice issues given\r\nhis client\'s investment in the property and Aspen Condominium at the Aspen\r\nAlps, and early defeat of the injunction efforts by Betty Amos against the\r\nPitkin County Public Trustee. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify; mso-line-height-alt: 10.8pt;">&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; mso-line-height-alt: 10.8pt;">Holland\r\n&amp; Hart represented the property owner Betty Amos and her late husband\'s\r\nestate. Amos had failed to timely redeem, but sought to redeem after the\r\ndeadline. Ferguson and his client established at the TRO and Injunction phases\r\nthat an alleged redemption letter was ineffective and likely never sent. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; mso-line-height-alt: 10.8pt;">&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; mso-line-height-alt: 10.8pt;">The\r\nproperty owner then unsuccessfully challenged the foreclosing bank\'s Rule 120\r\nproceeding for the Public Trustee sale and also failed to enjoin the Public\r\nTrustee from awarding the deed to Ferguson\'s client -- Aspen Alps 123, LLC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; mso-line-height-alt: 10.8pt;">&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; mso-line-height-alt: 10.8pt;">Just\r\nbefore trial, the property owner tried to add a bid rigging claim under\r\nColorado Antitrust Act, section 6-4-106, C.R.S. (2011). Plaintiffs\' untimely\r\nmotion to amend to add the antitrust claim was denied but bid rigging was then\r\nallowed as a defense at trial. The trial court found that no bid rigging had\r\nbeen established and awarded Ferguson\'s client the property, as well as fees\r\nfor an improper lis pendens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; mso-line-height-alt: 10.8pt;">&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; mso-line-height-alt: 10.8pt;">On\r\nthis limited and unusual trial record, the Colorado Court of Appeals reversed\r\ncertain of the trial court&#8217;s findings and held that bid rigging had occurred as\r\nopposed to joint bidding. The Colorado Supreme Court granted certiorari on the\r\nnotice and bid rigging issues and in fact on the issue of a remedy for the\r\nalleged bid rigging. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; mso-line-height-alt: 10.8pt;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; mso-line-height-alt: 10.8pt;">Critical\r\nto Matt Ferguson\'s limited liability company client and its 3 members, the\r\nColorado Supreme Court determined that, based on the limited trial record in\r\nthe case, the property owners had failed to establish bid rigging in violation\r\nof the Colorado Antitrust Act, section 6-4-106, C.R.S. (2011), as a defense.\r\nThus rather than looking to the certified issue of an appropriate remedy as\r\nraised by Holland &amp; Hart, aspen attorney convinced the Colorado Supreme\r\nCourt to look at the Court of appeals findings altogether. The Supreme Court\r\nreversed the Court of Appeals&#8217; antitrust finding and held that illegal bid\r\nrigging had not occurred. Aspen Alps lawyer noted the important and novel legal\r\nissues in the Colorado Supreme Court\'s decision and a balancing of the rights\r\nof bidders at foreclosure sales. Ferguson stated that he was &quot;delighted\r\nthat the members of the Aspen Alps 123, LLC were now vindicated after being\r\naccused by Amos and Holland &amp; Hart as bid riggers on the eve of trial and\r\nbeing found as such on the flimsiest of a record\r\nand with little or no due process.&quot; The Supreme Court of Colorado found\r\nthat the members of the LLC has simply pooled their resources to take title and\r\nfound nothing in the record that could support reversing the trial court\'s\r\nfinding that nothing had occurred that would have established an anti-trust\r\nviolation. Ferguson was able to adduce evidence at trial to counter the\r\nAnti-Trust defense that 2 of the 3 bidders, who had bid competitively and well\r\nabove the bank\'s bid, had no more funds to bid higher than the $1.860,000 that\r\nwas accepted by the Public Trustee for the Aspen Alps Condominium. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; mso-line-height-alt: 10.8pt;">&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; mso-line-height-alt: 10.8pt;">Aspen\r\nAttorney Matt Ferguson can be reached at www.mattfergusonlaw.com or (970)\r\n925-6288.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;">&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nJune\r\n22, 2012 - COLORADO &#8211; Aspen Lawyer -- Matthew C.

aS'Approximately 10 million car crashes occur each year on American roads.  The Department of Transportation (DOT) reports that car accidents cost up to $200 billion annually.  More importantly, auto accidents put the safety of many Americans at risk.  A person is injured in a car accident every 10 seconds in the U.S.  Sadly, a car accident causes a fatality every 12 minutes according to the DOT.\r\n\r\nAccording to the American Automobile Association (AAA), the vast majority of U.S. car accidents occur as a result of driver error or negligence.   The AAA compiled a list of the leading causes of auto accidents in the U.S.  The car accident attorneys at Lessin &amp; Gompers reviewed the list and have compiled the top three to help increase your knowledge and arm you with important safety information.\r\n\r\nDistracted Driving\r\n\r\nA primary cause of automobile accidents is distracted driving.  AAA estimates that 25 to 50 percent of all traffic accidents are caused by distracted drivers.  Distracted driving involves anything that takes a driver&#8217;s eyes and focus off of the road.  This could include talking on a phone, texting, eating, reading, grooming, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you&#8217;re still not convinced that driving distracted causes deadly car accidents, consider these statistics provided by AAA.  Drivers using hand-held cell phones are four times more likely to get into a car accident.  Alarmingly, drivers who are texting while driving are 23 times more likely to get into an auto accident. The message is simple: put down the electronic device and pay attention to the road to reduce your risk of getting into a car accident and potentially save your life.\r\n\r\nSpeeding\r\n\r\nDriving over the speed limit is illegal in all of the 50 United States.  However, drivers continue to speed at alarming rates.  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, speeding causes approximately one-third of all car accidents in America.  The Insurance Institute of Highway Safety (IIHS) reports that 900 Americans die monthly in fatal car accidents due to speeding.  A good safety tip is to slow down and obey the speed limit.  It is simply not worth saving a few minutes to put your own or someone else&#8217;s life in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nDriving under the Influence of Alcohol and Drugs\r\n\r\nAn estimated 12,000 people are killed annually as a result of DUI accidents.  DUI auto accidents are serious and one of the most dangerous types of accidents that occur on American roads.  However, a DUI car crash can be easily prevented.  A sober designated driver can be selected ahead of time, the car keys of an intoxicated driver can be taken away and a safe ride home can be called.\r\n\r\nThe car accident lawyers at Lessin &amp; Gompers want the public to be aware of the leading and common causes of auto accidents.  With increased awareness and education, drivers can be more mindful and responsive to the many dangers that may be encountered on the road.  The safety of our clients and the public is of the utmost importance to us.  \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia Car Accident Lawyers Represent Victims of Auto Accidents\r\n\r\nIf you&#8217;ve been involved in an auto accident, you may be entitled to compensation for lost wages, property damage, medical treatment and pain and suffering. The Philadelphia personal injury lawyers at Lessin &amp; Gompers understand the complexities involved in auto accident cases and have the knowledge, litigation skills and resources to seek justice and maximum compensation for our clients.

aS'<p>Because a motorcycle lacks crashworthiness, motorcycle accidents typically result in more serious injuries than an accident involving two passenger vehicles. According to motorcycle accident data, 23 percent of riders involved in a collision sustain more than one injury and almost 30 percent of riders suffer a permanent disability because of their motorcycle crash injuries. Serious injuries can instantly change a rider&#8217;s life. Some injured riders may never be able to perform even the simplest daily tasks or participate in their favorite activities, such as motorcycle riding. A skilled Oakland motorcycle accident injury lawyer can help injured riders obtain financial compensation for the costs associated with treating a serious injury. </p>\r\n<p><b>Motorcycle Accident Head Injuries</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Under California Vehicle Code &#167; 27803 (a) &#8220;A driver and any passenger shall wear a safety helmet meeting requirements established pursuant to &#167; 27802 when riding on a motorcycle, motor-driven vehicle, or motorized vehicle.&#8221; Despite state law, many riders do not wear a helmet when operating a motorcycle, which increases their chances of suffering a serious head injury in a crash. Head injuries can affect the scalp, skull and brain, and often result in varying degrees of brain damage. Head injuries can be either open or closed. An open head injury describes an injury where the dura mater (outermost layer of the protective covering of the brain) has been penetrated. A closed head injury describes an injury in which the dura mater has remained intact. For example, a concussion is a very common closed head injury. Doctors typically use a non-contrast CAT scan to diagnosis a head injury. Depending on the severity of the head injury, treatment may include surgery and a variety of pharmaceuticals. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Motorcycle Accident Spinal Cord injuries </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Damage to the nerve roots surrounding the spinal cord can result in a severe spinal cord injury. Depending on the location and severity of the injury, symptoms of a spinal cord injury can vary. Some victims may experience complete or incomplete paralysis, incontinence, loss of sensation, diaphragm dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and inability to regulate heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature. Doctors may perform surgery to remove any bone fragments from the spinal canal and to stabilize the spine. Although most patients never fully recover from a spinal cord injury, rehabilitation can help some individuals function more independently. \r\n\r\n</p><p><b>Oakland Motorcycle Accident Victims&#8217; Legal Rights</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you or a loved one suffered a serious injury in an Oakland motorcycle accident, you may be entitled to accident-related damages. Because you only have once chance to recover compensation for medical bills, lost earnings, and pain and suffering, it is imperative you seek the assistance of a reputable Oakland motorcycle accident lawyer.

aS'When people get behind the wheels of vehicles and head out onto \r\npublic roads, they basically must face an ongoing series of decisions in\r\n terms of sharing the roads with others. All of these decisions must be \r\nmade correctly in order for danger to be avoided, and unfortunately this\r\n is not always what occurs.

These situations are\r\n often more dangerous than those that occur at four-way stops because \r\nmotorists are moving at high rates of speed. As a result, people who \r\ncrash in these situations can be forced to endure enormous forces of \r\nimpact.</p>\r\nWhy Yielding Mistakes Are So Dangerous\r\n<p>When someone is supposed to yield the right-of-way to another driver \r\nand he or she fails to do so, it will often lead to a California car \r\naccident because there is little if any time to take corrective steps. \r\nIn addition, these crashes often lead to serious injuries and fatalities\r\n because the people involved in them are completely surprised with the \r\nmistake of the other driver and they are not prepared to deal with it. \r\nTherefore, many of the crashes that occur because of this mistake \r\ninvolve high rates of speed and force.</p>\r\nHow San Diego Personal Injury Lawyers Can Help\r\n<p>When someone is injured in a crash that was caused by a driver who \r\nfailed to yield the right-of-way properly, that person could face some \r\ndifficulty proving what happened, as these incidents usually occur in an\r\n instant and those involved may not have clear memories of how they were\r\n caused.

aS'We\'ve all tripped, slipped and fallen.  All of us have, every single one of us.  Some people slip in the shower and laugh it off.  Others fall off of a roof to their death.  Falls are the number one cause of injury-producing accidents every year, causing more than one million injuries.  Slips-and-falls are a serious hazard both physically and psychologically, which is why there are so many personal injury law firms that provide expert legal advice for individuals who have fallen due to the negligence of others.  \r\n\r\nHave you been injured in a fall?  Do you know if it was a negligent fall - if someone else\'s carelessness is responsible for your injury?  If you suspect that it was, it may be a good idea to contact a slip-and-fall personal injury attorney.  Actually, it is a good idea!  Now, as you prepare to call for a free consultation, go back through the event in your mind and think about a few things.  Most importantly, what kind of fall was it.  Here are some different slip-and-fall accidents:  \r\n\r\nA - trip-and-fall accident.  This is when pedestrians fall because of a foreign object.  For instance, if you fell in a super market because a can was in an aisle or there was some foreign liquid or substance on the walking surface that made you fall.  \r\n\r\nB - step-and-fall accidents.  This is when there is an actual inconsistency in the walking surface, like a hole or a bubble.  An example of this would be if you fell because a rug was torn or there was a hole in the sidewalk.  \r\n  \r\n  C - stump-and-fall accidents.  This is when someone falls because something was sticking out of the surface on which they were walking.  An example of this would be if you fell over a nail sticking out of a wooden floor.  \r\n\r\nAccidents like these always happen when we least expect them - when we are walking to our car, down a supermarket aisle, on an elevator or in a stair well.  Perhaps your landlord didn\'t adequately inform you that the front hall had just been waxed and you slipped and broke your hip?  Perhaps a gas station didn\'t clean up after an engine oil spill and you slipped and hit your head?  Perhaps your child or your spouse fell and was injured so severely their lives will never be the same?  Whatever the case may be there are literally thousands of ways for you to seriously injure yourself from a slip-and-fall accident. \r\n\r\nIf you or a loved one has been injured or died in a slip-and-fall accident and need help determining whether or not you have a case, you need to contact an experienced personal injury attorney as soon as possible to determine what legal options you may have.

aS'<p>&#8220;LOSER PAY&#8221; LAWS ARE A GIMIC &#8211; </p><p>AND IGNORE OUR OWN TRADITIONS</p><p>Texas Governor Rick Perry recently signed into law a tort reform bill that drastically reshapes the civil justice system in that state.&#160; The new law requires plaintiffs who lose civil lawsuits to pay the attorneys&#8217; fees of defendants and punishes plaintiffs who do not accept settlement offers, in certain circumstances.&#160; Make no mistake; the real intent of this law is to discourage legitimate claims by injured people, not &#8220;frivolous&#8221; ones.&#160; It is not surprise that this law comes out of Texas, as Texas has already instituted major changes in tort law over the last decade, including changing their state constitution to allow artificial caps on non-economic damages in medical malpractice cases.&#160; In other words, the people of Texas were conned into narrowly voting to give up their own rights to hold bad doctors accountable for the full measure of the harm they cause.</p><p>Some provisions of the law bring Texas in line with other states. For example, the law introduces a procedure called a &#8220;<a href="http://www.tylerpaper.com/article/20110627/NEWS08/110629782">motion to dismiss</a>&#8221; into the state&#8217;s civil procedure rules. Before the new law, trial court judges were limited in the way they could dismiss meritless lawsuits early in the process. Forty-two other states have similar provisions on the books, including Indiana.&#160; These types of procedures are actually legitimate ways to eliminate claims with little or no merit.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Texas law does not stop there.&#160; Instead, the Texas legislature went &#8220;where very few other states have gone,&#8221; by requiring plaintiffs who lose in court to pay the attorney fees of the defendants.&#160; The law also contradicts hundreds of years of jurisprudence in America.&#160; The &#8220;American Rule&#8221;&#8212;rejected and replaced by the new Texas law&#8212;has long recognized that facilitating access to the civil justice system for all litigants (regardless of wealth) was more important than reaching the correct result in any one case on the awarding of attorneys&#8217; fees. In fact, in 1796, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to award attorneys&#8217; fees to the winning party because it went against the &#8220;general practice of the United States.&#8221; </p><p>Proponents of the new law claim it will increase efficiency and rid the state legal system of frivolous lawsuits. The sponsor of the bill in the Texas House of Representatives, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2011/05/24/loser-pays-takes-another-step-toward-becoming-the-law-in-texas/">Brandon Creighton</a>, argues that the law will &#8220;make a party think twice about bringing a case without merits.&#8221;&#160; <a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/news/speech/16204/">Governor Perry</a> adds, &#8220;Employers will spend less time in court and more time creating jobs.&#8221;</p><p>Critics respond that the law will prevent injured plaintiffs with <a href="http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Letters-to-the-editor-2078058.php">legitimate claims</a> from being made whole in court.&#160; These critics assert that the new law &#8220;takes away rights from the injured&#8221; and &#8220;attempts to limit access to our civil courthouse.&#8221;&#160; Individuals with valid, but not guaranteed, claims may never file a lawsuit because they simply cannot afford to lose with their limited financial means, or are intimidated by the very thought of paying the other side&#8217;s fees.</p><p><a href="http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20110703/ISSUE01/307039974#">Joanne Doroshow</a>, executive director of the Center for Justice and Democracy, explains, &#8220;This is not about frivolous lawsuits; it&#8217;s about blocking legitimate lawsuits. So if you or your child is injured as a result of corporate wrongdoing and even if you have a strong case, you probably won&#8217;t ever bring that case because of the economic devastation you might face if you lose.&#8221;&#160; Doroshow contends that the argument in favor of the new law rests on an inaccurate assumption that the legal system is full of frivolous lawsuits. &#8220;There&#8217;s absolutely no evidence of that,&#8221; she says.</p><p>Governor Perry put the passage of the new law on his list of &#8220;<a href="http://www.chron.com/life/houston-belief/article/Perry-unsure-of-his-role-at-Houston-prayer-rally-2078551.php">emergency items</a>,&#8221; but legal scholars contend there is little indication that frivolous litigation was a problem in Texas. Charles M. Silver, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, reports that no serious academic study has found frivolous litigation to be a significant problem in the United States (outside of an isolated area of law in securities class actions). Silver says it&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/us/11ttloser.html?&#95;r=3">just ridiculous</a>&#8221; to think that, before the new law, plaintiffs were filing suits that were not &#8220;overwhelmingly meritorious.&#8221;</p><p>Trial court judges in Texas certainly weren&#8217;t clamoring for additional tort reform.&#160; An article in a law journal in Texas found that 86 percent of Texas trial court judges opined there was no need for additional tort law reforms after a law passed in Texas in 2003 that placed strict caps on damages awards. &quot;Those judges are not shy about asking for additional tools to resolve cases if they need them,&quot; personal injury attorney Earl Drott says.&#160; Drott acknowledges that tort reform law is &#8220;complicated and misleading&#8221; but important to the lives of both liberals and conservatives alike. &quot;I have represented many conservatives and small business owners who are aghast when tort reform is applied to them and they find out how unfair it is and how different it is than the way that was presented to them,&quot; he says.</p><p>The new law also includes a second provision that severely punishes a plaintiff for rejecting a settlement offer that is greater than what the judge or jury ultimately awards in the case at trial.&#160; Specifically, the new law requires plaintiffs who reject a settlement offer, and later win a verdict at trial, to pay the defendant&#8217;s attorneys&#8217; fees if the amount of trial verdict is less than the original settlement.</p><p>One legal scholar illustrated the provision of the law this way: &#8220;Consider a person who has been hurt in a car accident and sues an insurance company for $100,000. The insurance company invokes the Texas &#8216;Loser Pays&#8217; rule with the newly passed amendments to the state law and offers $80,000. The injured person, or plaintiff turns the offer down and decides to opt for a jury trial, where he is awarded $50,000 by the jury. But the accident victim would not recover that $50,000, because the insurance company incurs an additional $25,000 in attorney\'s fees by going to trial.&#160; The newly enacted revisions to the Texas law states that the accident victim would not receive that full amount&#8212;instead, he would get $25,000. The other $25,000 of the settlement would go toward the insurance company lawyer\'s fees and other court costs associated with that trial.&#8221;&#160; The new provisions of the law that works to shift costs to prevailing plaintiffs can &#8220;wipe out&#8221; an entire award and leave the plaintiff with nothing.</p><p>Texas State Representative Craig Eiland, who opposes the new law, put in context this second provision of the new law with a real-life example from his former law practice. &quot;This is not just the loser pays bill. This is the loser pays, and sometimes the winner pays,&quot; Eiland explains. He tells the story of a client of his who rejected a <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/tx/PubArticleTX.jsp?id=1202493408173&slreturn=1&hbxlogin=1">settlement offer</a> of $80,000 &#8220;because it contained a confidentiality clause that the client believed would prevent him from clearing his name of a crime he said he didn\'t commit.&#8221; The case went to trial, and Eiland\'s client eventually won $75,000, just under the original settlement offer with the confidentiality clause. Under the new law, Eiland&#8217;s client would be forced to pay the defendant&#8217;s legal fees, even though the plaintiff won at trial. &quot;I don\'t think that\'s right,&#8221; Eiland declared.</p><p>Fortunately, the law was moderated slightly towards the end of the legislative session.&#160; A compromise provision allows the plaintiff to collect attorney fees from the defendant&#8217;s insurance carrier if the plaintiff beats the final offer to settle by 20%.&#160; So, if the final offer is $100,000 and the plaintiff recovers $120,000 or more, then the plaintiff can invoke the new law and collect their attorney fees.&#160;</p><p>The Texas law could become even more relevant to the lives of Hoosiers, as some commentators have speculated that the move in Texas will &#8220;blaze the trail&#8221; for governors in other states to push &#8220;loser pays&#8221; laws.&#160; Check back at this blog for updates on this and other issues of civil justice in Indiana.</p><!--more-->Make no mistake; the real intent of this law is to discourage legitimate claims by injured people, not &quot;frivolous&quot; ones.'

Often clients will elect to reach a settlement rather than submit to the added time, expense and emotional upheaval that a <a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/practice-areas/Divorce/" target="&#95;blank">divorce</a> trial requires. </p><p>The length of time it takes to complete a case depends upon how complicated the financial or <a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/practice-areas/Child-custody/" target="&#95;blank">custody situation</a> is, the court&#8217;s calendar, and how quickly the parties can agree to resolve it.</p><p>Another tangible is your spouse&#8217;s attorney. If they are obstructive, uncompromising or bent upon running up the time and costs of litigation, they must be dealt with aggressively. Suggestion is made that despite your other differences, spouses should agree between themselves that any attorney who does not facilitate the orderly progression of their case should be immediately discharged.</p><p>Where there is agreement about custody and very little property to be divided, it may take no more than a couple of weeks. Cases of increasing complexity require more time and can take anywhere from six months to a year. The rare court trial that occurs is generally the culmination of two or three years and can cost tens of thousands of dollars.</p><p><a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/divorce-faqs/">Read more about common Chicago divorce law questions and answers here...</a></p><p><u>About Us:</u></p><p>Established in 1990, <a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/">the firm</a> focuses its\' practice on <a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/practice-areas/Divorce/">divorce law in Chicago</a>, <a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/practice-areas/Family-Law/">family law</a> and custody issues including <a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/practice-areas/Child-custody/">child custody</a>, visitation and <a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/practice-areas/Child-Support/">child support;</a> <a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/practice-areas/Alimony/">alimony</a>; dependency and termination of parental rights; criminal law and domestic violence.&#160;&#160; </p><p><u>On the Radio:</u></p><div>Each Sunday at 10:00 am (C.S.T.), we present &quot;UN-COMMON LAW&quot; &#174; the airwave\'s #1 rated show for interactive legal advice and commentary on <a class="zem&#95;slink" title="Air America Radio" href="http://www.airamerica.com/" rel="homepage">Air America</a>\'s Chicago affiliate, <a class="zem&#95;slink" title="WCPT" href="http://www.wcpt820.com/" rel="homepage">WCPT</a> 820 AM, and via the internet @ <a href="http://www.wcpt820.com/">www.wcpt820.com</a>.</div><div></div><div>We invite YOU to be our next guest, this SUNDAY and in the meantime check out our new blog for those seeking <a href="http://www.chicagodivorcenews.com/" target="&#95;blank">legal help in Chicago</a>: <a href="http://www.chicagodivorcenews.com/">http://www.chicagodivorcenews.com/</a></div><div></div><p>In addition to receiving general advice on matters concerning <a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/divorce-faqs/">divorce in Chicago</a>, <a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/practice-areas/Child-custody/">child custody</a>&#160;and <a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/practice-areas/Family-Law/">family law</a>, listeners also have the opportunity to ask <a href="http://www.lawyers.com/Illinois/Chicago/Kurt-A.-Muller-914889-a.html">KURT</a> specific questions which relate to their individual legal concerns by calling in at (773) 774-8585 and having their questions answered on - air both by MULLER and his featured expert(s) for the week.</p><!--more-->As a <a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/practice-areas/Divorce/">Chicago divorce lawyer</a> I frequently answer questions about <a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/practice-areas/Child-custody/">child custody law in Chicago</a>, <a href="http://smarttoughdivorcelawyers.com/practice-areas/Child-Support/">child support law in Chicago</a>&#160;and more...'

aS'<div class="detailSpacer articleDetailContent"><p>According to an experienced brain injury lawyer, at a few seconds rate, someone obtains a head injury due to various reasons. A large number suffer from such injuries annually, and sometimes suffer permanent disabilities because of it.</p>\r\n<p>Because of this, the leading causes of brain injury were gathered in order to set precaution.As reported by the CDC or the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, head injuries are the major cause of mortality in adults and in children. They have also found that these account to 44% of total injury related deaths in the country. And so, the following are, respectively, believed to be the five leading causes of traumatic brain injuries: Car accidents, Bicycle Accidents, Falls, Sports and Acts of Violence or Assault. &#160;If you are in accident that resulting in a brain injury contact a Traumatic Brain Injury Attorney immediately.</p>\r\n<p>The brain has a very dynamic in our body, and is also responsible for the normal functioning of many of our body systems. Therefore, if injury affects our brain, it may largely change our life as well. Injury in the brain may result to damage in our storage of information, homeostatic processes, and the accumulation and retribution of data. It may also result to unconscious emotional and social problems.</p>\r\n<p><b>Types of Head injuries</b><br />These injuries are highly avoidable, and most of the time does not yield permanent brain damage. However, amnesia, or forgetting what happened before, during, and right after the accident, sophisticated care should be given to someone who has possible head injury. Symptoms may show off days after the accident and may have worsened in time. These injuries may include bruises, lacerations, tenderness, abrasions, and other forms of damages that may be very detrimental.</p>\r\n<p><br /><b>The most common types of head injuries are:</b><br />? Loss of consciousness: shortly after the accident is one of the sure indicators of brain injury <br />? Concussion: jarring of the brain that may also result to loss of consciousness, but is less serious than a contusion.<br />? Brain contusion: it is a bruise or hematoma in the brain that may result to inflammation<br />? Skull fracture: the skull, or parts of it are broken which leaves the brain unprotected.<br />? Hematoma: bleeding or clot formation in the brain that is also indicative of a contusion<br /></p><p><b>Prevention of Such Injuries</b></p><p>In order to keep yourself safe from these injuries, it is very important to follow safety precautions at all time. These precautions are common, but are seen very effective not only to prevent brain injuries, as well as other injuries you can obtain through these accidents.</p>\r\n<p>Wearing of seat belts, helmets and other safety equipments when riding cars, bicycles and motorcycles has been a long time safety precaution. For pedestrians, especially at night, it is best to well bright colored clothing or other elements that would make you more visible at night. Children and infants should always be seated in the back seat, never in the front. Listening to music through head or earphones while walking down the streets is discouraged as it can ruin your concentration. It is also best to examine both sides of the street before crossing as to be certain that it is already safe to cross.</p>\r\n<p>To prevent falls, especially to the elderly, we encourage that you hold side rails or ask for assistance when going up or down the stairs. Avoiding slippery or wet floors is also a must. Clear passageways or walk ways with elements that may cause tripping or falling. Knowing potential side effects of medication may also ensure safety.

aS'<p>You have likely heard of the old phrase &#8220;Buyer Beware&#8221; or even the Latin Phrase &#8220;Caveat Emptor&#8221;.  In New Jersey, the Consumer Fraud Act has leveled the playing field, making it &#8220;Caveat Venditor&#8221; or &#8220;Seller Beware&#8221;.</p><p>In fact, the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act has for years been one of the country&#8217;s most far-reaching and comprehensive consumer protections laws.  New Jersey Courts have consistently construed the Consumer Fraud Act liberally in favor of consumers.  Many of the unscrupulous business practices you encounter or see on television such as the &#8220;Shame on You&#8221; type of news reports are likely included and fall into the Consumer Fraud Act. </p><p>The Consumer Fraud Act was drafted and has been amended to punish wrongdoers and does not take into consideration the good faith of business owners or merchants.  It is because of this, that all business owners need to be aware of this law and how it could be held against your business - particularly car dealerships, lending institutions and contractors. </p><p><strong>What is the Consumer Fraud Act?</strong></p><p>The Consumer Fraud Act prohibits any business from using deceptive or fraudulent practices  which may mislead, deceive or cause damage to a consumer (or his/her wallet) in connection with the advertisement or sale of any merchandise or real estate.  Some examples include misrepresentation of a product, price, durability, repair or one-sided transactions.</p><p>Most importantly, it is not necessary to provide that the merchant <strong><em>intended</em></strong> to engage in the unlawful conduct.  If the conduct is likely to deceive it is sufficient to allow someone to sue under the Consumer Fraud Act. The Consumer Fraud Act does not define the term consumer.  However, it has been interpreted to include individuals and merchants.  So even if it is a business that is engaged in a transaction as a consumer, the business can bring a claim against a merchant. </p><p><strong>Who can a Consumer Bring a Claim Against? </strong></p><p>Consumers can only bring a claim for damages under the Consumer Fraud Act against a merchant.  Practically speaking, most of the consumer transactions we engage in involve merchants.  Generally, a merchant is defined as a professional seller of goods, even if only on a part-time basis.  Examples of merchants include banks, residential and commercial landlords, businesses, franchisors and franchisees.  (The Consumer Fraud Act does not include buyers of goods and services (as opposed to sellers) and individuals engaged in individual one-time sales of goods such as a single sale on Ebay)</p><p><strong>Does the Consumer Fraud Act Apply to Contractors?</strong></p><p>The Consumer Fraud Act applies to any contractors engaged in the business of making or selling home improvements.  The Home Improvement Practices Act requires that all contractors engaged in home improvement to be licensed with the State of New Jersey.  All home improvement contracts in excess of $500 and change orders must be in writing and signed by the parties.  Failure to provide a written contract is a per se violation of the Consumer Fraud Act.  All home improvement contracts must include a detailed description of the work to be performed, materials used, a start and end date, the total cost and the warranty.</p><p><strong>What Constitutes a Sale of Merchandise under the Consumer Fraud Act?</strong></p><p>The Consumer Fraud Act is applicable to consumer transactions involving the sale or rental of merchandise.  Merchandise includes goods, information, services, real estate, travel, insurance or securities.  A sale of goods or services includes a sale, rental or offer to sell or rent. </p><p><strong>What Conduct is Prohibited by the Consumer Fraud Act?</strong></p><p>As set forth above, acts of deception, fraud, false promises, acts of misrepresentation and unconscionable commercial practices are unlawful.  Some examples include misrepresentation of a product, price, durability, repair or one-sided transactions.  Importantly, it is not necessary to provide that the merchant intended to engage in the unlawful conduct.  If the conduct is likely to deceive it is sufficient o set forth a claim under the Consumer Fraud Act.</p><p><strong>What is the Statute of Limitations for a Consumer Fraud Act Claim?</strong></p><p>The Consumer Fraud Act is governed by a six year statute of limitations.</p><p><strong>What Damages can a Claimant Recover under the Consumer Fraud Act?</strong></p><p>To recover under the Consumer Fraud Act a claimant must show that he or she suffered an ascertainable loss of money that was proximately caused by a violation of the Consumer Fraud Act.  Ascertainable loss is generally the amount of money to make a claimant whole.  However, the Consumer Fraud Act limits damages to those that are economic in nature, thus excluding damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering.  A successful claimant is entitled what is called treble (three times), which is punitive in nature.  An award of treble damages is mandatory for successful claimants.  In addition to treble damages, a successful claimant is entitled to reasonable counsel fees.</p><p>Whether you are a consumer or merchant in New Jersey, it is important to be aware of the implications of the Consumer Fraud Act.

aS'<p>Although you are not required by law to have a lawyer, you should still consult with one to protect your rights, even if you know you are innocent. The advice and expertise of a lawyer can result in faster and better results for you, which is why it is always recommended that you should be represented by a lawyer for a criminal case. </p><p>If you wish to not have a lawyer represent you in court, you should still seek advice from one. An attorney&#8217;s advice will help you understand the nature of the charges against you, possible defenses you could use in court, plea bargains that would most likely be offered to you, as well as what could potentially be your punishment if you are convicted.</p><p>If you choose to have a lawyer represent you, a lawyer will evaluate all aspects of the circumstances regarding your case, explain what to expect at every step of the legal process, and take all necessary action to ensure that your legal rights are protected. Having a lawyer will also save you time because they will research any litigation pertaining to your case, interview witnesses, collect all important records and documents, prepare necessary paperwork, and plan your defense strategies for you. Lawyers are also acquainted with important legal rules that are hidden in court interpretations of state and federal constitutions and they are familiar with local court procedures that are not put into writing. </p><p>If you know you are innocent and you want to meet with a lawyer, you should act as soon as possible. Lawyers need plenty of time to prepare; therefore, it is always better to start looking for a lawyer sooner than later. Deadlines also are a key factor in acting as fast as possible. You do not want to miss a deadline that could potentially cause you to lose your individual rights.&#160; </p><p>In some cases you may not be able to afford a lawyer. In situations such as this, you may be eligible to be represented by the Public Defender&#8217;s Office.

Without a Wedding Agreement, a surviving spouse might have the right to claim a large portion of the other spouse\'s property, leaving much less for the kids.<br /><b>Use a <a href="www.thepeabodylawfirm.com">Revocable Trust</a> as Part of Your Plan.</b>&#160;&#160; Another valuable that often accompanies the Wedding Agreement is a well versed Revocable Intervivos (&#8220;Living&#8221;) Trust.&#160; The Living Trust provide further estate planning and often further delineates the post death plan for marriages with a Wedding Agreement.&#160; The kids will like their new dad or mom much better if they know that their inheritance is protected.<br /><b>Avoid the Unsuspecting Spouse Rule.&#160;</b> Prenuptial or Wedding Agreements do have some limitations:&#160; these documents typically only speak to the issue of assets.&#160; However, with most relationship failures being attributed to financial debts, make sure debt issues are also covered in your Wedding Plan.&#160; Make sure you know what debts your soon be bride or groom are bringing to the party.&#160; Especially in these times, good credit and a small debt load may be crucial to your economic survival.<br mso-special-character: line-break" /></div><div LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN: 0in 0in 9pt; BACKGROUND: white; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-outline-level: 3" class="MsoNormal">So You Don&#8217;t Think You Need One&#8230;</div><div LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt; BACKGROUND: white" class="MsoNormal"><br />Okay.&#160; You are truly in love and this is the one that is going to last.&#160; Hopefully, you are right.&#160; However, wouldn&#8217;t you feel better knowing that you have planned for all contingencies?&#160; The <i>Wedding Plan </i>provides you with the financial assurances that go beyond ironing out community property issues.&#160; You can also identify beneficiaries to your joint estate, figure out the most appropriate tax treatment of your assets.&#160; And, use a life insurance policy to enhance the value of the assets you are leaving (no I am not a life insurance agent&#8212;nor do I benefit from any life insurance you purchase because of this advice) to your loved ones.<br /><br />Timothy P.

Perhaps one of the least expected causes of death during an operation\r\ninvolves &#8220;bleeding out&#8221; or massive hemorrhaging. Furthermore, when a hospital\r\neither doesn&#8217;t have a Massive Blood Transfusion Protocol (MTP), or frequently\r\nfails to follow it, a serious crisis can quickly escalate into death. When\r\nproper blood supplies aren&#8217;t readily administered, cardiac arrests and major\r\norgan shutdowns can quickly follow. Metabolic acidosis, hypothermia and\r\ncoagulation problems can prove deadly. (Patients who lose 50% or more of their\r\nblood in less than three hours are usually thought to be experiencing massive\r\nbleeding.) </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Before\r\nsigning consent forms for yourself or anyone you love, always ask what type of\r\nMTP the hospital or surgical clinic has in place. Of course, long before the\r\nday of surgery, you must <i>always</i>\r\npersonally discuss your chronic medical conditions (or those of the designated\r\npatient) and daily prescription dosages with the surgeon, specifically asking\r\nthat all such information be transmitted <i>immediately</i>\r\nto the anesthesiologist.

aS'<p>Luxembourg&#8217;s legal framework for alternative fund structures will be significantly extended as part of the draft legislation transposing the European Union&#8217;s Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive into national law.</p><p>In addition to implementing the directive, the Luxembourg legislation introduces changes designed to make the grand duchy significantly more attractive as jurisdiction for the management and structuring of private equity, venture capital and real estate fund vehicles.</p><p>The changes involve the updating and enhancement of two existing partnership vehicles, the standard limited partnership (societe en commandite simple) and partnership limited by shares (societe en commandite par actions), and the creation of a new special limited partnership (societe en commandite speciale).</p><p>Bill of law no. 6471 was submitted to the grand duchy&#8217;s Chamber of Deputies by finance minister Luc Frieden on August 24. It is scheduled for approval by parliament and on the statute book before the end of this year, well ahead of the deadline for AIFMD adoption of <br />July 22, 2013.</p><p>The changes to the existing partnership vehicles and the establishment of the special limited partnership involve amendment of the laws of August 10, 1915 on commercial companies and of December 19, 2002 on the Commercial and Companies Register and corporate accounting, as well as changes to Luxembourg&#8217;s Commercial Code.</p><p>They also involve changes to the February 13, 2007 law on Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs) and that of June 15, 2004 on Risk Capital Investment Companies (Sicars) to enable these types of fund to adopt the legal form of a standard limited partnership or special limited partnership.</p><p>The preamble to the draft legislation notes that the standard limited partnership is a very long-established type of company. It has antecedents in Roman law, although in its current form it dates back to contracts used in maritime trade contracts in 10th century Italy, and has also played an important role in spreading the concept of limited liability throughout corporate law, before becoming an important tool of the fund industry in recent years.</p><p>It also has deep roots in the grand duchy&#8217;s commercial law as a very lightly regulated type of commercial entity, whose legislative framework has barely changed since 1915. Despite certain constraints, contractual freedom is primordial in the structuring of such an entity.</p><p>Historically limited partnerships have been little used or understood in Luxembourg, France and Germany, although the number of standard limited partnerships and partnerships limited by shares on the Commercial and Companies Register has been growing in recent years.</p><p>The lack of attention paid to limited partnerships in a financial centres of Luxembourg&#8217;s importance is all the more surprising, the preamble says, given that partnerships are widely used for fund structuring in Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions, including the Channel Islands, UK dependent territories in the Caribbean and the US state of Delaware, and especially for the private equity and real estate investment sectors.</p><p>While Luxembourg already offers the fonds commun de placement (common contractual fund), which shares certain characteristics with partnership structures, which is used not only for Ucits funds but certain alternative investments such as property funds, private equity and venture capital firms have traditionally preferred the Anglo-Saxon partnership model.</p><p>Although standard limited partnerships enjoy a special status under the Sicar legislation, only a handful of Sicars have so far been structured in this way. That may be down to the fact that Sicars are regulated and common law partnerships are typically not so, but the introduction of the AIFM Directive could well prompt alternative fund managers to reconsider their domicile options in the future.</p><p>Whereas the standard limited partnership has a legal personality of its own distinct from that of its limited partners, the special limited partnership does not have legal personality and is designed to resemble as closely as possible the English limited partnership regime.</p><p>The existence of both types of vehicle, as is the case in Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions, provides industry participants with a maximum degree of choice and flexibility, allowing broad freedom of organisation within an efficient contractual structure.</p><p>Both the standard and special limited partnership regimes in Luxembourg provide managers and investors with the structuring flexibility expected in the sector as well as a legal framework for the general partner-limited partner relationship.</p><p>The Luxembourg government and the country&#8217;s fund industry hope that the availability of these options in an onshore civil law jurisdiction will consolidate the grand duchy&#8217;s position as a leading European jurisdiction for regulated alternative investment funds and managers of all kinds, bolstered by its long experience in fund domicile and regulation and the depth and expertise of its service offering.</p><p>Luxembourg already has a substantial private equity sector, including the management, domiciliation and servicing of both funds and transaction vehicles. However, being able to offer vehicles equivalent to those available in traditional offshore jurisdictions will reinforce the country&#8217;s appeal to leading private equity and private equity real estate houses as well as private and institutional investors that are used to and comfortable with Anglo-Saxon-type limited partnership structures.</p><p>The strategy of upgrading the standard limited partnership, as opposed to the creation of a Luxembourg partnership vehicle out of whole cloth, provides continuity in the grand duchy&#8217;s companies law as well as demonstrating its readiness to adapt with the times.</p><p>While the changes entail a number of innovations, they involve not so much a wholesale change in the standard limited partnership structure as refinement of the existing legislation while respecting the fundamental principles of the legislation on commercial companies.</p><p>The upgrading of the standard limited partnership and the introduction of the special limited partnership are likely to prompt increased use of partnership structures under the Sicar and SIF regimes for funds employing alternative strategies and/or aimed at sophisticated investors.</p><p>The changes to Luxembourg law involved in the reform of the limited partnership regime are contained in articles 182 to 201 of the draft legislation, entailing amendments principally to the 1915 commercial companies law (Articles 182-194), as well as to the 2002 law on the Commercial and Companies Register (Articles 195-200), and to the Commercial Code (Article 201), as well as assorted tax provisions.</p>'

While I-94 did not rank top of the list nationwide, it ranked significantly high.</p><p>While much of Route 66 no longer exists, dangerous curves and steep inclines made it one of Illinois\' most precarious highways, which at one point earned the nickname of Bloody 66.

aS'A company buying defective goods from another company may demand replacement of the defective goods, but not reimbursement for additional costs.<br /><br />GRP Rainer Lawyers and Tax Advisors in Cologne, Berlin, Bonn, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Stuttgart and London - www.grprainer.com/en conclude: In its ruling of October 17, 2012 (File No. VIII ZR 226/11), the 8th Civil Division of the Federal Supreme Court (BGB) has found that the judgment passed by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) of November 16, 2011 (File No. C-65/09. C-87/09) is not applicable to all contracts of sale between companies. For example, the cost of installation and dismantling is not to be refundable.<br /><br />The CJEU had ruled that a consumer may demand from a company under a claim of subsequent performance that in addition to dismantling the defective item, the replacement item had to be installed a well. While a company is able to demand dismantling and re-installation, it must pay the incurred costs.<br /><br />In its decision, the BGH has now ruled that this does not apply to a contract between two companies. It ruled that the CJEU judgment applies only to a contract between a consumer and a company. Furthermore, it should not be possible to transfer these principles to contracts of sale between companies in interpretation of the guidelines.<br /><br />In the law governing the sale of goods, a buyer must never become active himself if a defect is discovered. Contrary to the law governing service contracts, there is no right of self-performance prescribed by this law. The principle is that subsequent performance by the vendor takes precedence. In the law governing the sale of goods, the vendor should be able to remedy existing defects himself and to warrant this at a reasonable cost if possible.<br /><br />A buyer who purchases a defective item should therefore proceed correctly from the beginning to avoid facing the costs himself. In such a case, it is always recommended to consult a lawyer with experience in civil law who can review the existing claims and plan further action. For companies, it is worthwhile to have a lawyer formulate the contracts from the start.<br /><br />http://www.grprainer.com/en/Civil-Law.html'

aS'Last week, the EEOC adopted an enforcement guidance on the use of arrest and conviction records in employment decisions. It issued a&#160;<a href="http://eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/4-25-12.cfm" text-decoration: none; color: rgb(136, 136, 136); font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">press release</a>,&#160;<a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/arrest&#95;conviction.cfm">the guidance document</a><a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/arrest&#95;conviction.cfm">&#160;itself</a>, and a&#160;<a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/qa&#95;arrest&#95;conviction.cfm">question-and-answer document</a><a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/qa&#95;arrest&#95;conviction.cfm">&#160;about the guidance</a>. With the guidance in mind, now is a good time for employers to scrutinize how they use such records to make hiring decisions.<br color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); " /><br color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); " />The EEOC\'s concern is that the use of such records may have an disparate impact on those with protected characteristics. As the guidance document explains, &quot;Nationally, African Americans and Hispanics are arrested in numbers disproportionate to their representation in the general population. In 2010, 28% of all arrests were of African Americans,&#160;even though African Americans only comprised approximately 14% of the general population.&#160;In 2008, Hispanics were arrested for federal drug charges at a rate of approximately three times their proportion of the general population.&#160;Moreover, African Americans and Hispanics were more likely than Whites to be arrested, convicted, or sentenced for drug offenses even though their rate of drug use is similar to the rate of drug use for Whites.&quot;<br color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); " /><br color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); " />Nonetheless, anti-discrimination law recognizes that the wrongful conduct revealed by arrest and conviction records may be sufficiently job-related to justify their use despite a disparate impact. The EEOC says that employers may rely on convictions if (1) data validates the use of convictions for particular offenses as predictors of subsequent work performance, or (2)&#160;the employer determines which convictions will be considered by considering the nature of the crime, the time elapsed since the conviction, and the nature of the job, and then provides an opportunity for an individualized assessment for people excluded by the screen to determine whether the policy as applied is job related and consistent with business necessity.<br color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); " /><br color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); " />Because they are not proof of wrongdoing, arrest records alone should never be relied upon to make employment decisions. However, the fact of an arrest may prompt the employer to investigate the circumstances of the arrest and conclude that disqualifying misconduct did occur. The guidance documents gives the following example if a proper use of the fact of an arrest:<br color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); " /><ul padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2.5em; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 2.5em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 21px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "><li padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.25em; margin-left: 0px; ">Andrew, a Latino man, worked as an assistant principal in Elementary School for several years. After several ten and eleven-year-old girls attending the school accused him of touching them inappropriately on the chest, Andrew was arrested and charged with several counts of endangering the welfare of children and sexual abuse. Elementary School has a policy that requires suspension or termination of any employee who the school believes engaged in conduct that impacts the health or safety of the students. After learning of the accusations, the school immediately places Andrew on unpaid administrative leave pending an investigation. In the course of its investigation, the school provides Andrew a chance to explain the events and circumstances that led to his arrest. Andrew denies the allegations, saying that he may have brushed up against the girls in the crowded hallways or lunchroom, but that he doesn&#8217;t really remember the incidents and does not have regular contact with any of the girls. The school also talks with the girls, and several of them recount touching in crowded situations. The school does not find Andrew&#8217;s explanation credible. Based on Andrew&#8217;s conduct, the school terminates his employment pursuant to its policy.</li></ul>Other laws bar use of some arrest and conviction records without regard to their discriminatory adverse impact. For example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act&#160;bars consumer reporting agencies from&#160;reporting records of arrests that did not result in entry of a judgment of conviction, where the arrests occurred more than seven years ago.<div color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "><br />In California,&#160;arrest records may not be considered at all unless the arrest resulted in a conviction, or the applicant is awaiting trial.&#160;Employers may not inquire about marijuana convictions that are more than two years old.&#160;&#160;See&#160;<a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&group=00001-01000&file=430-435" text-decoration: none; color: rgb(136, 136, 136); ">California Labor Code sections 432.7, 432.8</a>.</div><!--more-->The EEOC has issued a guidance explaining that use of arrest and conviction records to make hiring decisions may violate anti-discrimination laws, unless the employer can justify the business necessity for rejecting an applicant with a criminal record.

aS"<p>Introduction to Texas Family\r\nLaw Mediation --&#160;(Primarily in Harris\r\nCounty, Texas)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Divorce mediation is a process where you and\r\nyour soon to be ex-spouse (or significant other) meet with a neutral trained\r\nthird party family law mediator to reach a settlement in your lawsuit (divorce\r\nor SAPRC or modification).&#160; Many people\r\ndon&#8217;t realize but a divorce or modification case is a lawsuit.&#160; (A SAPCR is a Suit Affecting the Parent Child\r\nRelationship in the State of Texas. A SAPCR is normally when the parents are\r\nnot married to one another but there are minor children involved.) </p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;A family law case is controlled by the Texas\r\nFamily Code which is available on-line.&#160;\r\nIn the larger counties in Texas, family law cases are handled in\r\nspecifically designated courts by judges that only handle family law\r\ncases.&#160; In smaller counties, judges hear\r\na variety of cases and only hear their family law docket on certain days of the\r\nmonth.&#160;&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cases such as probate, elder law, incapacity,\r\nand guardianship are controlled by the Texas Probate Code which is also\r\navailable on-line and they are handled by a different set of courts.&#160; Again, in smaller counties, judges will hear\r\nall cases presented to them on specific dates.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no time limit to the mediation so that\r\nyou have time to explore and discuss options.&#160;\r\nSome mediations can take 2 hours and some can last 12 hours.&#160; If progress is being made, usually the\r\nparties don&#8217;t want to stop their mediation. Additionally, while most mediations\r\nare a one-time event, sometimes the parties can agree to stop a mediation and\r\nagree to meet again at a later date.&#160;\r\nWhy? Perhaps additional information is needed by the parties to make a\r\ndecision or one party is overwhelmed and needs time to think about their\r\noptions.&#160; Again, the parties are in control. &#160;The mediator is there to assist the parties in exploring all the options available to them. &#160;The mediator may or may not be an attorney. &#160;Many mediators are not attorneys.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no limit as to what issues can be\r\ndiscussed - spousal support, child support, assets, debts, visitation,\r\nchildren's hobbies, children's special needs, etc.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if a party admits to child abuse or\r\nthreatens to commit a crime then the mediator MUST immediately stop the\r\nmediation process. &#160;Other than those situations, mediation is a\r\nconfidential, private process.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mediator cannot be called as a witness at\r\ntrial.&#160; The mediator does not keep notes\r\nof the mediation.&#160; At the end of the\r\nmediation, the mediator destroys all notes that were taken during the meeting. &#160; &#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both parties are urged to retain legal counsel\r\nsince the mediator cannot act as an attorney while serving as a mediator.&#160; The mediator cannot draft legal documents so\r\nan attorney is needed to prepare any legal documents that will be needed for\r\nthe Judge to sign to finalize the legal proceedings.&#160; The mediator cannot go to court with the\r\nparties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people like mediation because it is\r\ncheaper and faster than going to court. &#160;It is a much more informal\r\nprocess than going before a Judge.&#160; The\r\nenvironment is much more relaxed than the courtroom.&#160; Unlike the courtroom, the mediator does not follow any rules of evidence and people's &quot;feelings&quot; are honored. &#160;However, mediation is not a replacement for therapy.</p><p /><p /><p /><p /><p /><p /><p /><p /><p /><p /><p>The mediator asks both parties to be honest\r\nand negotiate in good faith. &#160;The mediator attempts to level the playing\r\nfield. &#160;Neither party is allowed to emotionally or physically abuse the\r\nother spouse. &#160;A mediator will attempt to diffuse emotions and focus on\r\ncommon goals to resolve your differences. &#160;You will not be forced to enter\r\ninto a final agreement. &#160;The process is entirely voluntary. &#160;However,\r\nit is essential that both parties disclose all assets and liabilities.&#160; If a party is dishonest or attempts to hide\r\ninformation then the mediation process cannot be fair and equitable.&#160; You always have the right to continue with\r\nlitigation and trial in front of a judge (or jury) if you are not satisfied\r\nwith the mediation process.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people like the fact that mediation is a\r\nprivate and confidential process. &#160;The offers made cannot be mentioned to\r\nthe Judge. &#160;(Just like the Las Vegas ad -- what happens at mediation,\r\nstays at mediation.) &#160;Often the mediator will &quot;think outside of the\r\nbox&quot; and bring creative solutions that a judge could not offer because the\r\nJudge must follow the Texas Family Code. &#160;A mediator can offer solutions\r\noutside the TX Family Code that might work better for you and your children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mediation can often begin the healing process\r\nto allow the parties to begin to co-parent their children. &#160;Even though\r\nthe marriage is ending, the parents will be co-parenting their children for the\r\nrest of their lives. &#160;In fact, they will be co-grand-parenting their\r\nfuture grandchildren. &#160;It is often said that a marriage might be ending\r\nbut the family endures. &#160;Mediation is much less adversarial that a trial.\r\n&#160;At trial, &quot;mud&quot; will be slung to show how bad each of you are -\r\nthe hurt feelings are traumatic and will probably impact the children.\r\n&#160;After &quot;slinging&quot; all that dirt then you get to leave the courthouse\r\nand try to co-parent your children together. &#160;Mediation helps the\r\ndivorcing couple create a parenting plan that focuses on what is best for the\r\nparents and the children. &#160;No judge knows you and your children as well as\r\nyou do. &#160;A judge will make decisions -- but they will probably be\r\ndecisions that neither party likes. &#160;&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mediation is usually not recommended if there\r\nhas been extensive physical or mental abuse. &#160;Attorneys recognize that\r\nthere are a small percentage of cases that just need to go to trial in front of\r\na judge.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you reach an agreement, everyone signs a\r\ndocument called a Mediated Settlement Agreement (MSA) that is filed at the\r\ncourthouse. &#160;It is binding and cannot be changed. &#160;In other words,\r\nyou are &quot;stuck&quot; with what you sign. The case is done - finished -\r\ncompleted. &#160;Then an attorney must take the MSA and prepare the final\r\npaperwork so that a judge can sign it so that can be &quot;enforced&quot; at a\r\nlater date if one of the parties does not follow the agreements that both of\r\nyou agreed to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mediation is one form of alternative dispute\r\nresolution (ADR). &#160;There are many excellent websites that cover mediation.\r\n&#160;Each state handles mediation slightly differently. &#160;In the State of\r\nTexas, mediation is normally required before you can get a trial date before a\r\njudge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most family law attorneys won't tell their\r\nclients this when a case first starts, but over 90% of family law cases settle\r\nbefore trial before a judge or jury. &#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very few family law cases in the State of Texas\r\nchoose to have a jury trial for a variety of reasons:&#160; (1) juries only hear a limited number of family\r\nlaw issues; (2) costs of a jury trial -- expect to pay over $20,000 if you want\r\na jury trial; (3) it might take up to 2 years to get a trial date from the\r\njudge.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a family law case in Harris County,\r\nTexas, anticipate being sent to mediation before you get a hearing date in\r\nfront of a judge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the Harris County judges now require\r\nthat you attend mediation BEFORE having a temporary order hearing. Therefore,\r\nyou could be ordered to attend mediation at the beginning of your case and\r\nagain at the END of your case.&#160; WHY?&#160; In Harris County the family district courts\r\nare overwhelmed with cases and the judges need to move their dockets\r\nalong.&#160; They have found that the majority\r\nof cases can be resolved at mediation.&#160; The\r\njudges have found mediation to be productive in the bulk of cases.&#160; It thereby allows them time to handle the\r\nsmall number of cases that require their time and attention.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are 2 free mediation services in Harris\r\nCounty, Texas - the DRO and the DRC.&#160; You must meet income &amp; other qualifications for\r\nthese free mediation services.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Private mediators charge from approximately $250-$1,000\r\nper side for 4 hours. &#160;</p><!--more-->Introduction to Texas Mediations"

Below are a few tips and reminders\r\nas your district proceeds through the budget and tax rate adoption process:</p><p>\r\n\r\n<b>Budget</b></p><p>\r\n\r\nThe\r\ndistrict&#8217;s superintendent prepares and recommends a budget to the board of\r\ntrustees. &#160;The board of trustees then\r\nadopts the final budget. For most districts, the budget must be adopted by\r\nAugust 31.&#160; When proceeding through the\r\nbudget adoption process, please remember:</p><p>\r\n\r\n?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Post the\r\nSummary of the Proposed Budget on the district&#8217;s website or in the\r\nadministrative offices at the same time the notice of budget hearing is\r\npublished.</p><p>\r\n\r\n?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The notice\r\nof the budget hearing must show per student and aggregate spending on\r\ninstruction, instructional support, central administration, district\r\noperations, debt service and any other category designated by the commissioner,\r\nas well as a comparison to last year&#8217;s spending in those categories.</p><p>\r\n\r\n?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The notice\r\nof budget hearing must be published at least 10 calendar days before the\r\nhearing.&#160; Check your local newspaper\r\npublication dates and timelines to ensure that you submit the notice to the\r\npaper on time.</p><p>\r\n\r\n?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The district\r\ncan adopt the tax rate at the same board meeting as the budget.&#160; Only one hearing is required, at which\r\ncitizens may speak to either the budget or the tax rate or both.&#160;&#160; </p><p>\r\n\r\n?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Once a final\r\nbudget is adopted, post the budget on the district&#8217;s website.</p><p>\r\n\r\n?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Remember\r\nthat budgets may be adjusted at any time, as many times as needed, through the\r\nbudget amendment process.</p><p>\r\n\r\n&#160;</p><p class=" " line-height: normal;"><b>Tax Rate </b></p><p>\r\n\r\nDistricts\r\nmust also adopt their tax rate by the later of September 29 or 60 days after\r\nreceiving the certified appraisal roll.&#160;\r\nOnce districts receive the certified appraisal roll (which should have\r\nbeen sent out July 25), districts may no longer rely on certified estimated\r\nvalues for setting the tax rate and will not be able to use the early tax rate\r\nelection process.&#160; At this point in the\r\ngame (in August), if your school district has not yet taken action toward\r\nadopting a tax rate but is considering adopting a tax rate that is higher than\r\nthe rollback rate, it will need to hold a tax rate election on the November 8,\r\n2011, uniform election date by ordering your election no later than September\r\n7, 2011.&#160; TREs could be a whole separate\r\nTexas ISD article, so we won&#8217;t go into more detail than that.&#160; Be sure to contact your attorney if you plan\r\non conducting a TRE to be sure that all timelines and procedures are followed.&#160; Regardless of whether your district plans on\r\nholding a TRE, when adopting the tax rate, remember the following:</p><p>\r\n\r\n?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The total\r\namount of property taxes imposed cannot exceed the preceding year&#8217;s tax rate\r\nunless the school district gives notice of intent to consider an increase and\r\nconducts a public hearing. </p><p>\r\n\r\n?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The tax rate\r\nmust be adopted via an order or ordinance, and specific motion language must be\r\nused to set a tax rate that exceeds the effective tax rate.</p><p>\r\n\r\n?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; You still must\r\npost your 72 hour meeting notice in addition to the 10 day notice of tax rate/budget\r\nhearing.&#160; School districts do not have to\r\nadopt the budget and tax rate at the same meeting, but remember to publish separate\r\nnotice if you will adopt your tax rate at a later date than your budget\r\nadoption.</p><p>\r\n\r\n?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If your\r\nschool district is subject to the equalized wealth notice, you must wait to\r\nadopt a tax rate until after the commissioner certifies your wealth\r\nequalization.</p><p>\r\n\r\n?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Unlike the\r\nbudget, tax rates are set once adopted, and cannot be amended.</p><p>\r\n\r\n&#160;</p><p class=" " line-height: normal;">The\r\ninformation in this article serves only as a preliminary starting point\r\nregarding the budget and tax rate adoption process.&#160; Please consult with your school attorney if\r\nyou have any specific questions regarding these issues.</p><p>\r\n\r\n</p>'

aS'<p>A <a title="Johns Hopkins Patient Safety Study" href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/johns&#95;hopkins&#95;malpractice&#95;study&#95;surgical&#95;never&#95;events&#95;occur&#95;at&#95;least&#95;4000&#95;times&#95;per&#95;year"><b><i>recent patient safety study by Johns Hopkins researchers</i></b> </a>estimates that 80,000 <b><i>&#8220;never events&#8221;</i></b> &#8211; <b><i>medical errors</i></b> that should &#8220;never&#8221; happen&#8221; -  occurred during surgeries in the United States between 1990 and 2010.  These errors, which put patients at extremely high risk for personal injury and even death, are said to occur at least 4,000 times each year.  Researchers collected and analyzed data from <b><i>medical malpractice cases</i></b> throughout the country over the two decades of the study period, but they say their estimate is probably lower than the actual number of events.</p><p>The <b><i>&#8220;never events&#8221;</i></b> identified by Johns Hopkins included three types of <b><i>surgical errors</i></b>.  First, leaving a foreign object such as a sponge or towel inside a patient, is said to occur approximately 39 times per week.  The second <b><i>surgical error</i></b> identified was when a surgeon performs the wrong procedure on a patient which happens about 20 times a week. The third <b><i>surgical error</i></b> is when a surgeon operates on the wrong part of the body site which also is estimated to occur 20 times a week.  Researchers hope that by identifying the magnitude of this problem, steps can be taken to address these errors.</p><b>Study Examined Thousands of Cases Involving Preventable Surgical Errors</b><p>The Johns Hopkins team used the National Practitioner Data Base to analyze <b><i>medical malpractice claims</i></b> throughout the country involving foreign objects, wrong patient, wrong operation, and wrong site procedures.  Of the cases studied in the 20-year period, they found 9,744 paid <b><i>medical malpractice settlements</i></b> totaling $1.3 billion.  in those cases, 6.6% of the patients involved died, 32.9% were permanently injured, and 59.2% were temporarily injured.  The more serious the outcome, the higher the settlement.</p><p>The <b><i>&#8220;never events&#8221;</i></b> occurred most frequently in patients between the ages of 40 and 49.  About a third of the surgeons involved were also in this age group, and 14.4% of them were over the age of 60.  Interestingly, 62% of the surgeons had been cited in multiple <b><i>malpractice reports</i></b>, and 12.4% were involved in separate <b><i>&#8220;never event&#8221; cases.</i></b></p><p>Surgical complications can occur for any number of reasons, but the study highlighted the frequency of preventable <b><i>surgical errors</i></b>.  Dr. Marty Makary of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who led the study, said that the findings highlight the vast amount of work to be done to ensure that these <b><i>medical errors</i></b> are prevented.  Dr. Makary reported that <b><i>medical malpractice claims</i></b> involving &#8220;never events&#8221; are usually easy to establish, because the damage can easily be proven.  Hospitals are required to report these events if a patient experiences complications after a surgery, but these complications are not always discovered.</p><b>Philadelphia Medical Malpractice Lawyers at Galfand Berger Fight for Victims of Surgical Negligence</b><p>Many surgical centers have safety measures in place to prevent <b><i>&#8220;never events&#8221;</i></b> such as the ones cited in the study.  These measures include mandatory &#8220;timeouts&#8221; before surgery to ensure that the correct patient and procedure are being prepped.  Counting sponges and other materials before beginning the surgery and using indelible ink to mark the surgical site before administering anesthesia also help prevent errors from occurring.  As the study shows, however, there is still a long way to go to ensure patient safety when undergoing surgery.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been injured due to a <b><i>surgical error</i></b>, the <a title="Philadelphia Medical Malpractice Lawyers" href="http://www.galfandberger.com/aop/medical-malpractice1/"><b><i>Philadelphia medical malpractice lawyers</i></b></a> at <b><i>Galfand Berger, LLP</i></b> are here to help.

aS'<p>Many a times, often due to unforeseen circumstances, individuals find themselves struggling to make monthly payments on ever increasing and overwhelming debt. For some individuals, overspending and living beyond one&#8217;s means can be attributed to their current debt situation. For many others, illness, divorce, or loss of employment is the primary cause of the individual&#8217;s existing financial strains and stresses. Receiving frequent calls and letters from the debt collectors increase the stress in the difficult situation. Fortunately, there are solutions for those dealing with what seems to be insurmountable debt. </p><p>Bankruptcy and debt settlement are two very different options for those involved in a financial crisis. In 2007, US Bankruptcy Courts reported almost 851,000 cases of individuals and businesses filing for bankruptcy. Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 are two types of bankruptcy, and bankruptcy is generally considered to be the best option. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy essentially eliminates an individual&#8217;s unsecured debt, and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy sets up a repayment plan over the next 3-5 years to pay off the individual&#8217;s debt. Bankruptcy can negatively impact an individual&#8217;s credit score as the bankruptcy stays on the credit report for up to 10 years but since most people who file bankruptcy already have bad credit this does not really affect them.</p><p>Debt settlement helps to provide individuals with a way to pay off debt but also negatively affects their credit. What the debt settlement companies do is have the consumer quit paying their credit cards and start making payments to the debt settlement companies who take their fees right off the top. The consumer will pay a set amount every month to debt settlement company who will NOT pay the credit cards and use the fact that the credit card is not getting paid to leverage the credit card company to settle the account for about 50%. This only happens once the debt settlement company has been fully paid by the consumer. Oftentimes the credit card company will refuse to settle the account and file bad credit information and also file lawsuits against the consumer who then will do what they should have done in the first place and file a chapter 7 or chapter 13 bankruptcy. In a chapter 7 or even a chapter 13 bankruptcy the most a person will pay back on credit cards is 10% of their total credit card debt. In addition debt management companies fees are unregulated and can end up being extravagant. Bankruptcy fees are set by the Federal Bankruptcy Court and capped to protect consumers. It is advisable to avoid debt<br />settlement companies if possible. </p><p>The <a href="http://www.schwilmlawfirm.com/">Schwilm Law Firm</a> concentrating on <a href="http://www.schwilmlawfirm.com/Charlotte-chapter-7-bankruptcy/">bankruptcy in the Charlotte NC</a> area can assist individuals in determining which avenue will best suit their needs and current debt situation.

aS"<p>Studies have shown that Americais not producing enough American graduates from the fields of\r\nScience, Technology, Engineering and Math. They are supposed to fill the increasing and fast demand for highly technical jobs in the mentioned expertise. Furthermore, according to the National Science Foundation, there are not that many Americans who are enrolling in these STEM degrees. It is feared that there would be a demand for 800,000 workers with STEM degrees but only 550,000 Americans will have the qualifications to meet such demand come 2018.</p>\r\n<p>The United States&#8217; immigration policies, on the other hand, make it hard to formulate and make use of aggressive strategies that could tap immigrant employees and entrepreneurs. They could have covered the deficit as well as further development and innovation within the STEM fields.</p>\r\n<p>US Senators, in a rare political team up from both the Republican and Democratic parties, are working together to solve both problems &#8211; through another immigration law reform. They are pushing to pass the Startup Act 2.0 into a law. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>The Startup Act 2.0 bill intends to ease the restrictions on immigrants who have advanced STEM degrees or are pursuing these degrees in the United States. According to the Senators who are pushing for Startup Act 2.0, the bill will encourage entrepreneurs and innovators within the numbers of these foreign graduates to stay and start their own businesses in the country. Such will attract and retain foreign talents as entrepreneurs, and pave the way for the creation of more jobs. More jobs would definitely mean a better economy.</p>\r\n<p>Young companies were noted to have created the most number of new jobs during the past years. They account for the average of 3 million net new jobs created between the years 1985 to 2005. It is also interesting that more than 40% of the companies listed in Fortune 500 were built by an immigrant or a child of an immigrant, and 60% of foreign graduate students in the United States back in 2010 were from science and engineering courses. It would indeed be such a waste of talent if the US, because of its\r\nstrict immigration policies, will continue to drive them back to their own countries despite having earned their degrees in the country.</p>\r\n<p>The proposed bill also looks forward to be able to encourage investment in startups and exempt these young companies from capital gains tax and some other forms of tax credit, provided they do meet the required amount as annual revenue. The effects of increased business startups will hopefully give rise to better policies and continued analysis that could foster economic growth.</p>\r\n<p>Startup Act 2.0 could indeed be an immigration breakthrough that will allow America to continue to reel in the highly skilled workers the country needs to compete in the global economy. Senator Moran, a prime mover of this bill, sees it as a way to get America's economic engine roaring once again. However, he does fear that the looming elections politics might get in the way of signing the Startup Act 2.0 bill into law.</p>"

aS'<div class="Section1"><p>Meeting with a client recently reminded me of a topic that we have explored before. That is, smart tax planning for retirement accounts.</p><p>In particular, in this case, both husband and wife had both IRA accounts and 401K Plan accounts. This particular family had other assets including a family business and two residences. They intended to make charitable gifts at the second death using their trusts as the vehicle for disposition of property at that time. The second point that was raised involved retirement income or rather cash for current living expenses. Charitable Gifting. It always makes the most sense to use retirement plans to implement charitable gifts at death. This is the most tax efficient way to benefit a favorite charitable, religious or educational organization. The nonprofit entity can liquidate its share of the plan without paying any income tax. If the charitable gift had simply been made from the trust, an individual beneficiary would have been stuck with income taxes of 30% or more on withdrawing the same sum from the retirement plan. </p><p>How does one implement a charitable gift of a retirement account? Assuming that the charitable gift is to be made at death, the charity is named as a beneficiary. Normally, the charity would be listed for a fixed percentage. The plan sponsor might permit a percentage with a cap or a fixed amount.</p><p>Another alternative is to set up a separate retirement plan, by making a transfer from an existing IRA, for example, with the charity as the sole beneficiary. This is probably the cleanest and simplest way to plan for charitable gifting. The amount in the charitable IRA account can be regulated by withdrawals, or maintained by taking distributions from other plan accounts. Sometimes a client will provide in his or her trust that the charitable gift be augmented if the IRA account is less than a specified amount. </p><p>If the charity is named as only one of the beneficiaries of a plan, the family should be aware that there are time limits on making the distribution to charity after the death of the account owner. Otherwise, the stretch feature for the individual beneficiaries may be lost. This is another good reason for using a separate account for charitable gifting. </p><p>Important Reminder. This discussion brings up another point that married couples sometimes forget. For example, if a couple intends that their church or university is to get a gift of $50,000 at death, they should make sure that the spouse with the largest retirement plan take steps to be sure that the gift is made at the death of the account owner. Otherwise, the surviving spouse is likely to roll the account into her own IRA with beneficiaries that she can change at any time. (Assuming, the wife is the survivor, which is generally the assumption made in commentaries like this.) We have seen charitable intentions defeated often by inaction, intentional or unintentional, by the surviving spouse. Income Tax Planning During Lifetime. Another useful way to reduce income tax is to carefully plan distributions from retirement accounts so as to take no more than the Minimum Required Distribution (MRD). This should be done by using income and/or principal from other investments to meet current living costs. As any income tax advisor can attest, income tax planning for seniors can be a delicate matter. </p><p>Tax on social security benefits can be a huge variable for many people who do not have significant pension income and live off investments, social security and retirement plans.</p><p>Financial planners and other income tax advisors should study their client&#8217;s investment portfolio and income sources to devise strategies for minimizing retirement plan withdrawals and income taxes in general. Many times cash for current needs can be provided from principal (not taxable income). This can reduce or eliminate income tax on social security.</p><p>For example, couples with a substantial investment portfolio can use annuities and other vehicles to defer the recognition of capital gains and ordinary income. This can reduce taxable income and avoid income tax on social security payments. Remember the old adage, &quot;don&#8217;t pay income taxes unless you have to!&quot;. </p>&#160;&#160;&#169;BRANDT, FISHER, ALWARD &amp; ROY, P.C.<br /><i>This newsletter is provided for informational purposes and should not be acted upon without professional <br />advice.</i></div>'

aS'<p class="Publishwithline"><strong><hr />ESTATE PLANNING DEFINED</strong></p><p><strong>Can The Trustee of a Continuing Trust Who is Also The Beneficiary Withdraw Trust Principal?</strong> </p><p><strong><u>Issue</u></strong>: I recently received the following question from a Caller:</p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt"><em>I am a beneficiary of a &#8220;Bypass Trust,&#8221; which was set up after my Father&#8217;s death and had been managed for the benefit of my Mother during her remaining lifetime. My Mother just died. I have been told that my share of the property remaining in The Bypass Trust is to be put into a Continuing Trust for my lifetime benefit. I was also told that I am the Trustee of the Continuing Trust. Since I am the Trustee of the Continuing Trust and I am the only beneficiary during my lifetime, do I have to keep the property in the Continuing Trust? The property that will go into the Continuing Trust for my benefit is real estate, which I had hoped to contribute to an LLC. What are my options?</em></p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt">I responded to the Caller as follows:</p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt">First and most important: <strong><em>Always</em></strong>, <strong><em>always</em></strong>, <strong><em>always</em></strong> start by reading all of the provisions of the document (or documents) that will govern your <strong>Continuing Trust</strong>. What document might that be? That document will almost always be the same document that your parents signed when they first created their own Trust. You must also familiarize yourself with any amendments your parents, or either of them, made to that original trust document. I know it&#8217;s boring and may seem like a useless exercise, but you will find some real gems hidden in the provisions of that document&#8212;and you will help yourself at the same time. </p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt">Pay close attention to the sections of the document that discuss your rights&#8212;<strong>as a beneficiary</strong>&#8212;to distributions of trust principal and to trust income. Trust Income may take the form of interest on bank accounts held in your <strong>Continuing Trust</strong>, or rental payments by the tenants renting real property held in your <strong>Continuing Trust</strong>, or dividends paid on any mutual funds or shares of stock held in your <strong>Continuing Trust</strong>. </p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt">Generally, even if you are the Trustee of your own <strong>Continuing Trust</strong>, the property deposited into your <strong>Continuing Trust</strong> must stay in the <strong>Continuing Trust</strong> (with some exceptions, explained below). Even though you are the Trustee, you cannot simply pull the property out of the Trust and put it in your name. Your parents would have left the property <strong>outright</strong> to you if they wanted you to have the property in your own name. However, depending on your personal financial and health-related circumstances, you&#8212;as Trustee&#8212;may be entitled to distribute to yourself&#8212;as the beneficiary&#8212;trust principal of the <strong>Continuing Trust</strong> for your <strong><em>bona fide</em></strong> health, education, support, and maintenance needs. You will almost always be entitled to all of the net trust income earned by the assets held in the <strong>Continuing Trust</strong>. However, with regard to distributions of trust principal OR trust income, <strong>you must read the document</strong> that governs the <strong>Continuing Trust</strong> to know for sure what your rights are as a beneficiary of the trust.</p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt">In addition, even though you are the Trustee of your <strong>Continuing Trust</strong>, you may have to account for your actions as Trustee to other persons (other beneficiaries) who would inherit the property, if any, that remains in your <strong>Continuing Trust</strong> upon your death. This is a <strong>primary reason</strong> that you cannot simply take the property out of the Trust and put it in your own name&#8212;you would have to notify those other beneficiaries of your intention to pull the property out of the Trust and may even have to get their approval before doing so. </p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt">You also said you wanted to contribute the real property that is to be held in your <strong>Continuing Trust</strong> to a Limited Liability Company (an &#8220;LLC&#8221;). Even if you could not take the property out of your <strong>Continuing Trust</strong> and put it in your own name (and then contribute it to an LLC), you MAY be able&#8212;in your capacity as Trustee of your <strong>Continuing Trust</strong>&#8212;to contribute the real property to an LLC. It&#8217;s just that your <strong>Continuing Trust</strong> would be a member of the LLC, instead of you, an individual, being a member of that LLC. In exchange for contributing property to the LLC, the <strong>Continuing Trust</strong> would receive a membership interest in the LLC. However, before you, as Trustee, do this, you <strong>MUST BE SURE</strong> that the terms governing the <strong>Continuing Trust</strong>&#8212;especially the terms governing your actions as Trustee of the <strong>Continuing Trust</strong>&#8212;permit the Trust to hold interests in entities like LLCs, and permit the Trust to transfer trust property into an LLC in exchange for an interest in the LLC. If you wish to transfer trust property into an LLC, you may also have to notify (and even get the approval of) the other beneficiaries of the Continuing Trust who would receive the property that remains at the time of your death. </p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt">Finally, I don&#8217;t know you, so please don&#8217;t take this personally, but please keep in mind that your parents had their reasons for keeping your share of The Bypass Trust in a <strong>Continuing Trust</strong> for your lifetime benefit. Many of my clients do the same thing. Their overall goal is to protect the property they want their children to enjoy&#8212;sometimes from the children themselves! Some children are not good with money, or are in marriages that could end in divorce (and subject the inherited property to division between the child and soon to be ex-spouse), or are disabled and easily taken advantage of. Any of these reasons are valid reasons for parents to leave property for their children in Continuing Trusts like yours.</p><p TEXT-ALIGN: left; MARGIN: 12pt 0in" class="JaysDividerSymbol" left"><hr /></p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Please note that the information in this blog post does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact-specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

About 15 people are killed every day as a result of truck accidents, creating a public safety crisis in Michigan and across the nation. But an amazing new development has occurred that might really start making a difference in protecting the public and keeping unfit truckers off our roads. </p><p>On Friday, the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), announced it was awarding NIC Technologies, LLC, the contract for a National Motor Carrier Pre-Employment Screening System.</p><p>This new service is designed to spread commercial truck drivers&#8217; safety and driver performance history as part of a more comprehensive pre-employment screening process. It will assist the trucking industry in assessing individual operators&#8217; crash and safety violation inspection history as a pre-employment condition. Drivers will also be able to obtain their individual history.</p><p>The new system may launch as early as December 2009. It will be developed and maintained using a self-funded, transaction-based model. It is anticipated that users of the service will pay a subscription fee of $100 per year and a $10 transaction fee for each record pulled. There will be additional fees for records requested via fax or mail. Individual truck drivers requesting their own record will not be subject to any subscription fee.</p><p>As an experienced truck accident lawyer who has spoken and testified about the dangerous lack of safety today regarding truckers and trucking companies that choose to disregard mandatory truck safety laws, I applaud the Obama administration and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.&#160; I hope Secretary LaHood is indeed correct when he said, &#8220;Safety is our number one priority at the Department of Transportation.&#160; This new initiative will help trucking companies ensure the safest drivers are behind the wheel of commercial trucks and buses&#8230;Making this information more transparent will make our roads and highways safer for everyone.&#8221;</p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><strong>How the Pre-Employment Screening System Can Help Truck Accident Lawyers </strong></p><p>For lawyers handling truck accident cases, this new service could also be an incredibly important new source of discovery about the truck driver who causes a crash.&#160; Lawyers should add this to standard interrogatories to trucking companies to see if they have subscribed or checked new hires with this service. (Visit our web page on how to use SafeStat to determine the <a title="Finding the dirt on unsafe truck companies" href="http://www.michiganautolaw.com/truck-accident/laws-regulations/unsafe-truck-companies.php" target="&#95;self">safety of any truck company</a> in the U.S.)</p><p>I&#8217;ve blogged and lectured to other trucking lawyers about new theories of liability, including making available a former employer&#8217;s insurance policy limits for failure to report past safety violations. I wonder if this new service may also open up new avenues of liability to trucking companies that routinely ignore their obligations under the FMCSR to report accidents, as well as drug and alcohol violations of former employees who then go on to cause serious crashes.</p><p>It seems that a company that fails to report similar violations to this new service may also be vulnerable, and rightly so, for a claim against it for violating reporting requirements in the type of case where the new employer would argue it never would have hired an obviously unfit truck driver if past safety violations had been evident.</p><p>My thanks to my friend, <a title="Joe Fried" href="http://www.frg-law.com/lawyer-attorney-1379619.html" target="&#95;blank">Joe Fried</a>, at Fried, Rogers, Goldberg in Atlanta for alerting me to this new development.&#160; Keep up the great work and results, Joe.</p><p><strong>Steven M.

aS'<div DISPLAY: block" id="previewbody">Three former assistant prosecutors in the State&#8217;s Attorney Office in Cook County, Illinois were terminated in 2007 and then filed age discrimination suits under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). On appeal before the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the court held that the prosecutors are, by definition, policymakers, and are therefore exempted from coverage of ADEA, thus, dismissing the actions. The Wisconsin Law Journal has an <a href="http://wislawjournal.com/blog/2011/01/06/prosecutors-cant-sue-for-age-discrimination/">article</a> on the ruling:<br /><br /><blockquote><p>The ADEA gives immunity to states and their political subdivisions from suits by certain employees. Among the employees excluded from the ADEA are &#8220;appointee[s]on the policymaking level.&#8221;<br /><br />The court concluded that all of Illinois&#8217; Assistant State&#8217;s Attorneys are appointees on the policymaking level and therefore not within the coverage of the ADEA.<br /><br />Under the 7th Circuit&#8217;s ADEA precedent, an employee is an appointee if &#8220;the position held by the individual authorizes, either directly or indirectly, meaningful input into<br />governmental decision-making on issues where there is room for principled disagreement on goals or their implementation.&#8221;<br /><br />The court derived this test from Supreme Court cases permitting termination of individuals holding policymaking positions based on political affiliation. Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976). </p><p><br />The prosecutors argued they were not policymakers, and that, looking at their actual job functions and duties, each held a &#8220;low-level position.&#8221;<br /><br />The court acknowledged that, in some cases, where an employee&#8217;s role is uncertain, it is for the jury to decide whether the employee is a policymaker.<br /><br />But the court found that the duties of the prosecutors are clearly defined by precedents interpreting Illinois law, and render them policymakers.</p></blockquote>The case is <em><a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/tmp/4C0M5FQT.pdf">Opp v.

aS'How will filing for bankruptcy effect my divorce litigation?<p>If you are considering filing for <strong><em>bankruptcy</em></strong>, the first thing you want to do is consult with a <em><strong>bankruptcy</strong></em> attorney. He or she will advise you if filing is even an option for you. If it is and you are in the process of a <em><strong>divorce</strong></em> or thinking of filing for <strong><em>divorce</em></strong>, you absolutely want to discuss this issue with your <em><strong>matrimonial attorney</strong></em>.  If you are in the process of a <em><strong>divorce</strong></em> (i.e. you or your spouse has filed a Complaint for Divorce), filing for bankruptcy will definitely have an effect on your litigation.  Specifically, it will cause a stay to be issued in your matrimonial litigation.  This means that <em><strong>divorce case</strong></em> will not be able to proceed forward until the stay is lifted or your debts (or your spouses&#8217; debts if he/she is the one who has filed) have been discharged.  However, there are certain exceptions to this rule which are set forth under the Bankruptcy Code.  For instance, if your spouse has filed for bankruptcy in the middle of your <strong><em>divorce litigation</em></strong> and then he/she stops paying support, you can still file in the Family Court to enforce any support award that was previously entered.  The Family Court cannot however modify that award if a stay is in place.  You and/or your bankruptcy attorney can also ask the Bankruptcy Court to lift the stay if necessary.  Please refer to the Bankruptcy Code for more exceptions.  Accordingly, if you are very close to resolving your divorce litigation, you may want to wait to file for bankruptcy, if possible, so that your filing will not interrupt the divorce process.    </p>What if my spouse files for bankruptcy AFTER our divorce? <p>The majority of individuals getting divorced enter into a contract called a Property Settlement Agreement (&#8220;PSA&#8221;), which is then incorporated into their <em><strong>Final Judgment of Divorce</strong></em>.  The PSA should always set forth which party is responsible to pay which debt.  For instance, if the parties are $20,000.00 in credit card debt, it is likely that one party will agree to pay off $10,000.00 of the debt and the other party will do the same.  However, what happens if this credit card debt is in joint names and one spouse files for bankruptcy after the PSA is entered into?  The answer is that the debt which the other spouse was responsible to pay, will now become your debt!  So, what do you do then? </p><p>There are a few things you could do if you find yourself in this position, it all depends on the terms of your PSA.  For instance, if you  are paying support to your spouse and then he/she files for bankruptcy and leaves you with $10,000.00 of additional debt that he/she was supposed to pay, you can ask the Family Court to reduce or terminate your support obligation (depending on the duration and amount of alimony you are required to pay under the terms of your PSA) in order to make up for the additional debt you are now required to pay.  If you are not the supporting spouse but, your ex-spouse owns certain property, you can ask the Family Court to enter a Judgment against your ex-spouse, in the amount of $10,000.00, and you can place a lien against an asset owned by your ex-spouse.  Thus,  when he/she attempts to sell that asset, you can get paid from the sale of same and/or he/she will have to pay you for the amount owed before the asset can be sold.</p><p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p><p><em>Sarah Martine has been an associate at the family law firm of Adinolfi &amp; Lieberman since 2005.

Under the CLRA, however, the malice requirement is not necessary.&#160; Additionally, under the CLRA, Plaintiff&#8217;s may also obtain an order enjoining the methods, acts, or practices; restitution of property; court costs and attorney\'s fees; and any other relief that the court deems proper.&#160; This is a particularly attractive option if your goal is to get the business to stop conducting its business.&#160; </p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Which section of the code to file under is a decision that should be discussed in more detail with an experienced California attorney.&#160; Many factors go into decisions regarding whether to file as an individual or a class and where to file your lawsuit and they should be made with the help of a qualified legal professional.&#160; If you would like to discuss your situation with regard to A California Corporation with California attorney Emery Ledger, please feel free to contact him at his firm, Ledger &amp; Associates, at 1-800-300-0001 or online at <a href="http://www.ledgerlaw.com/">www.ledgerlaw.com</a>.</p><!--more-->If you are considering filing a lawsuit against a California Corporation, you may choose to file as part of a class action.&#160;&#160;A class action lawsuit is essentially when a group of people &#8211; called Plaintiffs in legal terms &#8211; file a lawsuit together against a Defendant.

She also argues that her termination was based upon unlawful \r\nretaliation that flowed from the letter she wrote, thereby violating her First \r\nAmendment right to free speech. The nursing home argues that the aide was fired \r\nfor insubordination, not for sending the letter to the state Board of Nursing, \r\nand that the aide sent the letter in anticipation of and to defend against the \r\nexpected termination of her employment.  </p>\r\n<p margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"> </p>\r\n<p center" margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: center; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>First Amendment Protected Speech and \r\nRetaliation</i></p>\r\n<p center" margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: center;"> </p>\r\n<p margin: 0in 0in 0pt 25.5pt; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 51, 102); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Would \r\na court find that the aide, in sending the letter to the Board of Nursing, \r\nengaged in &quot;constitutionally protected&quot; activity - activity protected by the \r\nfree speech clause of the First Amendment? No. </p>\r\n<p margin: 0in 0in 0pt 25.5pt; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 51, 102); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"> </p>\r\n<p margin: 0in 0in 0pt 25.5pt; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 51, 102); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The \r\nmost important part of the test that a court uses to determine if the First \r\nAmendment protects the speech of employees is whether or not the speech involves \r\nmatters of public concern. Not all employee speech is protected, only speech \r\nthat may be considered as relating to issues of political, social, or other \r\nconcern to the community. In addition, a court must determine whether the \r\ninvolved speech more closely resembles an employee\'s complaints regarding her \r\nsuperior\'s actions and her own responsibilities as an employee than a citizen\'s \r\nspeaking out on a matter of public decision making.  </p>\r\n<p margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>\r\n<p margin: 0in 0in 0pt 25.5pt; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 51, 102); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">In \r\nthis aide\'s situation, a court would most likely find that the letter sent by \r\nthe aide complaining about the nursing home\'s failure to follow a specific care \r\nprotocol does not rise to the level of a matter of public concern, such as a \r\nhospital failing to discharge its responsibilities in a timely or acceptable \r\nmanner.  A court would find that the aide\'s letter reflected her disagreement \r\nwith her supervising nurse\'s decision and individual treatment decision and was \r\nnot a matter of public concern. </p>\r\n<p margin: 0in 0in 0pt 25.5pt; text-align: justify;"> </p>\r\n<p margin: 0in 0in 0pt 25.5pt; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 51, 102); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The \r\nletter, which focused on the aide\'s claimed &quot;hostile work environment&quot; included \r\nonly vague allegations of the nurse\'s failure to follow procedures. Perhaps a \r\ncourt would rule differently if the letter alleged broad violations of unsafe \r\nconditions that threatened many of the residents\' health or a systemic failure \r\nof all of the nurses to provide adequate care, instead of whether or not an aide \r\nis allowed to change oxygen levels under the Board of Nursing\'s regulations.  A \r\ncourt would find that the aide wrote the letter in anticipation of a \r\ndisciplinary proceeding and that the aide based her comment upon her personal \r\nobservations of how her supervising nurse was carrying out her duties. Bottom \r\nline: the aide was complaining about the nurse\'s incompetent management of the \r\naide during patient care. </p>\r\n<p margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>\r\n<p margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 51, 102); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">If a court were to find that a &quot;matter of public concern&quot; \r\nwere present, a court would apply the balance of the test and would find for the \r\nnursing home. This is because a greater interest exists in allowing nurses to \r\nprovide emergency care for patients, than in allowing aides to disagree over \r\nwhat care is pertinent to which job description.</p>\r\n<p margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 51, 102);"> </p>\r\n<p margin: 0in 0in 0pt; color: rgb(0, 51, 102); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">A \r\ncourt would also find that the letter written by the aide was pursuant to the \r\naide\'s official duty as an aide and that she was not speaking as a citizen for \r\nFirst Amendment purposes; therefore, the United States Constitution does not \r\ninsulate her communication from employer discipline.  The aide\'s letter was \r\ndirectly related to what she perceived to be her official duty and whether the \r\ndirections she was given by the supervising nurse fell within her job \r\ndescription. The nursing home, as the employer, considered her letter \r\ninappropriate and imposed discipline. In conclusion, the aide\'s letter would not \r\nbe shielded under the First Amendment freedom of \r\nspeech.</p><p margin: 0in 0in 0pt; color: rgb(0, 51, 102); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;" /><p margin: 0in 0in 0pt; color: rgb(0, 51, 102); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">For further information go to <a href="http://www.barmak.com">www.barmak.com</a></p><a name="LETTER.BLOCK6">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>\r\n<p margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><b></b></p></b></a>'

And, What procedures to be followed?<p><b></b></p><p /><p><b>1. WHO ARE THESE 4,500 PEOPLE?</b></p><p>These are account holders at UBS only. This appears to be only a minority of US account holders. In fact, a 2004 document, if still to be relied upon, provides that there are about 52,000 account relationships. This is important to note some of these accounts are owned by more than one person or sometimes one person one. person has more than one account. So, this figure does not reflect reality.</p><p><b>2.

aS'<p />\r\n<p>\t&quot;I want a divorce, and let me tell you why!&quot; As a Florida family law and divorce attorney for nearly 28 years,  I often hear these words, or some variation on this theme, when a prospective client calls.   Although the Law Office of Cindy S. Vova, P.A. knows that listening to a client and caring about his or her family situation is an important part of the divorce and healing process, it is not important to the court.  In Florida, and that includes Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and every other county, parties need not cite to the court a &quot;reason&quot; for wanting a divorce other than that they have &quot;irreconcilable differences.&quot;  These &quot;irreconcilable differences can be as innocuous as a husband (or wife, I suppose) leaving the toilet seat up, to waking up one morning with the epiphany that one does not wish to spend the rest of his life with the person lying next to him (presumably his wife).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn fact, according to an April 8, 2012 <i><u>New York Times</u></i><u /> article, New York was the last bastion of &quot;fault&quot; divorce, and even New York abolished this requirement in 2010. Thus, every state in this country has some form of no-fault divorce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tSo, the obvious question springing from this is, &quot;Doesn&#8217;t &#8216;no fault&#8217; divorce make it too easy to get a divorce?&quot;  Well, let&#8217;s consider the alternative...a divorce requiring&quot;grounds.&quot;  The United Kingdom still requires a party requesting a divorce to set forth and actually establish, to the satisfaction of the Court, that grounds exist.  According to the <i><u>Times,</u></i><u /> under British law, five categories exist under which where the court may grant a divorce.  These include:</p>\r\n<p>\t? Adultery (<i>pretty obvious</i>)</p>\r\n<p>\t? Abandonment (<i>relatively obvious</i>), and</p>\r\n<p>\t? &quot;Unreasonable Behavior&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, having probably represented parties in around 800 divorce cases, and having served as a Florida Supreme Court Certified Family Mediator in another 200 cases, I can tell you that nearly EVERY CASE contains some of what I, personally, would call &quot;unreasonable behavior.&quot;   That is, in part, because divorce is such an emotionally charged situation where even the most rational of individuals sometimes crack under the emotional and financial pressures that occur in divorces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn the UK, however, alleging &quot;grounds&quot; for a divorce adds yet another layer of emotional, and, dare I say financial strain, that, according to the <i><u>New York Times</u></i><u /> article, raises the level of absurdity in pleadings to be reminiscent of, in my humble opinion, a 1970s Monty Python skit.   For example, per the article, spouses have alleged that:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>? A wife was mandated by her husband to dress and speak as a Klingon (<i>wonder if <u>Star Trek</u> originally ran on BBC 1 or BBC 2</i>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? The serial abuse of repeated tuna casserole dinners (<i>based on the cuisine I&#8217;ve had in England that, arguably, may have been an upgrade</i>)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\t? &quot;Spiteful tampering with the TV antenna&quot; (<i>could cable have saved that marriage?</i>)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\t? A husband who &quot;usurped&quot; the wife&#8217;s control of the washing machine (<i>that might \t\thave been grounds to SAVE the marriage</i>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? A wife who &quot;without justification , flirted with any builder or tradesman&quot; (<i>I would guess her &quot;justification&quot; was that her husband couldn&#8217;t fix a &quot;bloody&quot; thing</i>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? A husband who insisted that Timmy, his pet tarantula, sleep next to the bed in a glass case (<i>hey, at least he didn&#8217;t insist it sleep on the pillow <u>sans</u> cage</i>), and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? A husband who insisted on controlling the television remote (<i>okay, so if this passed muster in a British court, I guess every wife in America would have grounds for divorce, particularly during football season</i>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can only wonder what &quot;fault&quot; was plead in Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana&#8217;s petition for divorce....</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\t     So why am I urging the British to abolish this arcane requirement to grant a divorce?  Although the legal system in the United States is modeled after the common law system we adopted from our friends across the pond (except of course Louisiana, that follows the French civil system, and caused me not to apply to Tulane Law School out of fear I&#8217;d have to learn more useless stuff..thank you Emory for having me!), it is time for the British to take a lesson from us.  No fault divorce does make divorce easier...when a marriage <i>should</i> end...It eliminates the need for people to write hurtful, silly and damaging allegations in their divorce petitions, let alone spend the time, effort expense and embarrassment of attempting to prove these allegations before a court.  </p>\r\n<p>\t</p>\r\n<p>\tSince Florida requires neither spouse to plead or prove this unreasonableness, nor, for the most part, does adultery play a role in the Courtroom, attorneys representing divorcing parties can concentrate on those matters that require &quot;reasonableness,&quot; specifically issues involving time sharing and a workable parenting plan with the children, equitable distribution of marital assets and debts, whether alimony is appropriate and, if so, whether the alimony should be bridge-the-gap, rehabilitative, durational, lump sum or permanent periodic, and child support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIf there appears to be no chance to &quot;save&quot; a marriage, then at our firm we concentrate on amicably resolving these issues as expeditiously as possible, and not spending our clients&#8217; money investigating affairs, and providing evidence to the court of Timmy Tarantula&#8217;s sleeping arrangements!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tCall us.

aS'<p>\r\nOne of the conundrums facing people mulling for bankruptcy is what protects their assets best. In fact, bankruptcy court does not care if consumers all along have been &quot;good Samaritans&quot; and because of income reduction or job loss they have been force to file for bankruptcy. The more assets such people have, the more creditors get paid. Consequently, it behooves such individuals to ensure they understand the legal ramifications of filing for bankruptcy and what chapter 7 and chapter 13 entail.&#160;</p><p><b>SOME CAVEATS ON FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY</b></p><p>Filing for bankruptcy adversely affects filer\'s FICO credit score, irrespective of whether it is chapter 7 or chapter 13. In fact, a reduction of <i>UP TO</i> 240 points for people with 780 FICO score and a reduction of UP TO 150 points for people with FICO score of 680 could reasonably be expected.</p><p><b>1. SOME BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CHAPTER 7</b></p><p><b>A. WHO SHOULD USE IT</b></p><p>Usually, people with no assets such as home or car to lose OR people who only have enough to cover daily expenses. However, such people have no money to pay for a payment plan.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>B. HOW IT IS USED</b></p><p>Non-exempt assets are sold, proceeds are given to creditors and most debts are forgiven. </p><p><b>2. SOME BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CHAPTER 13</b></p><p><b>A.

HOW IT IS USED</b></p><p>A payment plan is set up through the court for, usually, less than the amount owed. Payment are made over three to five years. The payments MUST equal at least the amount of money creditors would have received, if you filed for chapter 13.</p><p><b>3. SOME BASICS ON SOME ASSETS TO BE PROTECTED IN BANKRUPTCY</b></p><p><b>A. HOME</b></p><p>In general, holding onto your home depends on the state you live in and the equity in your house. If a house is worth less than its mortgage, i.e. there is no equity, the owner can keep it as long as the owner stays current on the mortgage.&#160;</p><p> If the homeowner has equity in the house, then most states allow the homeowner to keep some portion of the proceeds of trustee\'s sale. Over such limit, the proceeds are applied to the outstanding debt and paying the trustee. For instance, in CA the exemption limit is up to $175,000.</p><p><b>B. CAR</b></p><p>In general, car is like a home in some respect for bankruptcy purposes. This means, in most states, even if you owe more on the car than its value, you can keep it if you can keep your payments current. <b></b>Free and clear car owners may keep the car IF it is worth less than the state exemption. If you have some equity in the car and a loan, your car is sold and you will receive the equity up to the amount of the exemption.</p><p>&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;</p><p><i><b><a target="&#95;blank" href="http://www.lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Doron%20F,-d-,%20Eghbali.aspx">DORON EGHBALI</a> </b>is a Partner at the Beverly Hills Offices of <a target="&#95;blank" href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/">Law advocate Group, LLP. </a><a target="&#95;blank" href="http://www.lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Doron%20F,-d-,%20Eghbali.aspx">He</a> Primarily Practices <a target="&#95;blank" href="http://www.lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Practice%20Areas/Business%20Law.aspx">Business</a>, <a target="&#95;blank" href="http://www.lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Practice%20Areas/Real&#95;Estate&#95;Law.aspx">Real Estate </a>and <a target="&#95;blank" href="http://www.lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Practice%20Areas/Entertainment&#95;Law.aspx">Entertainment Law</a>. <a target="&#95;blank" href="http://www.lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Doron%20F,-d-,%20Eghbali.aspx">Doron</a> Can Be Reached at: 310-651-3065.

aS'<div class="post-body entry-content"><div justify">Joint Tenants Are Happy. Property owners are universally unhappy that the taxable value of their property gets &quot;uncapped&quot; at death. In the case of a married couple, the property gets uncapped at the second death, with taxable value rising to fair market value for the year after the second death.<br />A popular tactic in the circumstances has been for a husband and wife to execute a deed transferring the property to husband, wife and child, as joint tenants with full rights of survivorship. Alternatively, if husband dies first, wife can do the same thing, transferring the property to herself and son, as joint tenants.<br />The Michigan Department of Treasury has taken the position that in the circumstances described above, the property is uncapped when wife dies (the second death), unless the son was a joint owner in 1994, when the new property tax laws were enacted. </div><div justify">New Case. These were essentially the facts in a recent decision by the Michigan Court of Appeals in Klooster v. City of Charlevoix, decided December 15, 2009.<br />In Klooster, husband and wife, James and Donna Klooster, owned property as tenants by the entireties. In August, 2004, Donna quit claimed her interest to James. On the same day, James, the sole owner, quit claimed his property to himself and their son, Nathan Klooster, as joint tenants, with rights of survivorship.<br />James died in January, 2005. Then in September, 2005, Nathan executed a quit claim deed, creating a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship with his brother, Charles Klooster. The City of Charlevoix asserted in 2006 that the property had become uncapped at the death of James in 2005 and that the taxable value was to be uncapped, approximately doubling.<br />The Michigan Tax Tribunal affirmed the decision by the Assessor and the Board of Review that uncapping had occurred.<br />The question before the Court of Appeals was whether James\' death was a &quot;transfer of ownership&quot;, as defined by the Michigan statutes. Unfortunately, the specific sections of the statute are ambiguous.<br />Many practitioners throughout Michigan have observed this ambiguity and have assisted in the creation of joint tenancies, usually between parents and children, in the hope of avoiding an uncapping when the last parent dies.<br />Without getting into the technicalities of the Court\'s analysis of the statutory language, we would note that the analysis by the Court of Appeals will probably be challenged on appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court. </div><div justify">Trustworthy Decision? At this point, it is too early to say what the Michigan Supreme Court will decide and whether the Michigan legislature will address this potential loophole and clarify the language of the statute.<br />If the Klooster decision is upheld by the Supreme Court, taxpayers are faced with the further questions whether any legislative fix could be retroactive to joint tenancies created prior to a statutory change.<br />We have employed this strategy for clients on occasion, with the caveat that the Michigan Department of Treasury has consistently taken the position, in the facts outlined above, that the property gets uncapped at the parent\'s death.<br />Should clients rush out and attempt to do the same thing to forestall uncapping? That raises another question, &quot;what is the downside of trying?&quot;. Depending on the facts involved, there may not be much downside from clients trying to get in under the wire, where the facts are clear and where the creation of a joint tenancy fits in with the overall estate plan. </div><div justify">Stay Tuned.

This in turn leads to higher prices for that cup of coffee you may have bought this morning in Glendale. Injury litigation can have an economic impact but, in this case, fewer people are likely to be burned.</p><p><strong>Personal injury laws can improve business</strong></p><p>Not all personal injury laws mean higher prices passed on down the supply chain.&#160; Some create booms for specific industries.&#160; When you were a child, for example, you probably never considered wearing a bicycle helmet while cruising your neighborhood on your two-wheeler.&#160; Now, bike helmets are ubiquitous, thanks to personal injury laws that led to the legal mandate that all California cyclists under eighteen wear helmets.&#160; This certainly means slightly more of a cost outlay for your average cyclist, but the increase in safety is immeasurable. And the companies that manufacture such helmets are thriving.</p><p>Also consider hands-free devices in automobiles.&#160; Personal injury litigation has led to the widespread perception that talking on a cell phone while driving is a negligent act, since it distracts the driver and removes one hand from the steering wheel.&#160; Many states, including California, now maintain laws requiring the use of hands-free devices if you talk on a cell phone while driving.&#160; Again, this means pricier equipment for the consumer, but theoretically leads to safer driving conditions for all&#8212;and increased profit for electronics companies.</p><p><strong>Experienced Glendale personal injury lawyers</strong><br />If you or a loved one has been the victim of a personal injury, a case of insurance bad faith, or instance of funeral home abuse, contact the <a href="http://www.mylalawyers.com/firm-overview/">law firm</a> of My L.A.

aS'<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This is part 1 of a two-part series about tax issues affecting contractors.&#160; Part 2 will address the classification of property &#8211; whether an improvement is real or personal property.</em></p><p>In a construction contract, the contractor is deemed the consumer of any tangible personal property purchased that it incorporates into real property and, thus, must pay tax on the purchase of such property. The construction contractor is the consumer even though he may subcontract the actual labor to incorporate the materials into the real property. However, subcontractors who purchase materials for incorporation into a job must pay tax upon the purchase of the materials.</p><p>A contractor cannot use tax erroneously paid on the purchase of its materials as an offset against tax that should have been collected. For example, a contractor may erroneously believe property to be constructed is real property and remit the sales tax due on the materials as they are purchased while failing to collect tax upon completion of the project. Under such circumstances, the contractor can only obtain a refund of tax it erroneously paid on its materials.&#160;</p><p>To avoid the foregoing problem, a contractor is allowed to request certification from the owner as to the classification of the property &#8211; real or personal property &#8211; before the contract is executed.&#160; The owner must respond to the request, and the contractor can rely thereon so that the risk of erroneous classification is transferred to the owner.</p><p><strong>If in doubt, claim the resale exemption</strong><strong>&#160;</strong><strong>&#160;</strong></p><p>Since a contractor cannot always be certain as to whether property being purchased will be incorporated into real property or sold as tangible personal property, he or she should claim the resale exemption for any uncertain purchases. Use tax must then be paid on those materials subsequently incorporated into Ohio real property by the contractor, other than as part of an exempt construction contract .</p><p><strong>Claim an exemption for materials used on Exempt Construction Contracts</strong><strong>&#160;</strong></p><p>A contractor may claim exemption upon the purchase of materials to be incorporated into:</p><p>1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Real property under a construction contract with the U.S. government or its agencies, the State of Ohio, or an Ohio political subdivision;</p><p>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; Real property which is owned or will be accepted for ownership at the time of completion by the U.S. government or its agencies, the State of Ohio or its political subdivisions;</p><p>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; A house of public worship or religious education, or a building used exclusively for charitable purposes by a nonprofit organization operated exclusively for charitable purposes;</p><p>4.&#160;&#160;&#160; The original construction of a sports facility under &#167;307.696 of the Ohio Revised Code; or</p><p>5.&#160;&#160;&#160; A hospital facility entitled to exemption under &#167;140.08 of the Ohio Revised Code.</p><p>A contractee claiming one of the above exemptions must execute the Construction Contract Exemption Certificate available on the Ohio Department of Taxation&#8217;s website.&#160; A contractor is then protected from liability if it is later determined that the contract did not qualify for exemption; the contractee assumes liability for any unpaid taxes.</p><p>Rather than using copies of the Construction Contract Exemption Certificate when making purchases of materials, the contractor or subcontractor may use a Contractor&#8217;s Exemption Certificate when purchasing materials to be used for an exempt contract.&#160; However, this certificate only protects the vendor/seller of the materials.</p>'

Co.</i> (1997) 15 Cal.4th 882.&#160; In that case, the Court addressed the issue\r\nof whether &#8220;pay if paid&#8221; clauses were valid and enforceable.&#160; After analyzing the underlying policy of\r\nmechanic&#8217;s liens, the Court held that &#8220;pay if paid&#8221; provisions are invalid and unenforceable\r\nbecause they conflict with California public policy. &#160;The Court reasoned that when an owner fails to\r\npay the general contractor, &#8220;pay if paid&#8221; clauses result in an impermissible\r\nindirect waiver or forfeiture of the subcontractors&#8217; constitutionally protected\r\nmechanic&#8217;s lien rights. &#160;Consequently, in\r\nCalifornia, &#8220;pay if paid&#8221; provisions do not relieve the general contractor or its\r\nbond surety from the contractual obligation to pay subcontractors for work\r\nperformed on the project. </p>\r\n\r\n<p text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">Twenty-five years before the <i>Wm.

aS"<p>January is a good month to review and adjust automobile insurance\r\npolicies.&#160; Many drivers don't understand the types of insurance\r\navailable to cover car accidents.&#160; Moreover, rarely do drivers think\r\nabout their automobile insurance until after a car accident occurs.&#160;\r\nHowever, making prudent decisions about automobile insurance prior to a\r\ncar accident will alleviate a lot of stress and frustration in the\r\nevent of a car accident.</p>\r\n<p>The most basic automobile insurance in Texas is known as minimal\r\nlimits liability insurance.&#160; In 2008, Texas raised the minimal limits\r\nfor liability insurance from $20,000 to $25,000.&#160; Therefore, a minimal\r\nautomobile insurance policy in Texas provides $25,000 in liability\r\ncoverage per person, up to $50,000 maximum per car accident\r\n(25000/50000).&#160; If a driver is at fault for a car accident in Texas and\r\nhas minimal liability insurance, there may be insufficient insurance\r\ncoverage available for the at-fault driver, especially in the event of\r\na significant car accident causing severe damage and/or involving\r\nnumerous claimants.&#160; Without adequate coverage, Texas drivers may be\r\nexposing their assets to potential liability. If you have a minimal\r\nlimits liability insurance policy, you should contact your insurance\r\nagent to find out how much it would cost to increase your limits.&#160; Most\r\npeople are pleasantly surprised at how little the additional coverage\r\ncosts.</p>\r\n<p>Texas drivers have the option of adding Personal Injury Protection\r\n(PIP) to their automobile insurance policies.&#160; In the event of a car\r\naccident, PIP provides protection to an insured by covering up to 100%\r\nof incurred medical bills, and up to 80% of lost wages.&#160; Depending on\r\nthe insurance company, PIP coverage is generally available in amounts\r\nbetween $2,500 to $10,000.&#160; PIP coverage is a great way for an insured\r\nto protect against short-term financial losses immediatley following a\r\ncar accident.&#160; Again, you should contact your insurance agent to\r\ndiscuss this type of coverage.&#160; As with increasing liability limits,\r\nthe additional premium for PIP coverage is generally nominal.</p>\r\n<p>Another option for Texas insureds is underinsured/uninsured motorist\r\ncoverage (UM/UIM).&#160; UM/UIM coverage applies when an insured is involved\r\nin a car accident with another, at-fault driver.&#160; If the other at-fault\r\ndriver has no insurance, or has insufficient insurance, the insured can\r\nfile a claim for UM/UIM insurance benefits under his or her automobile\r\ninsurance policy.&#160; We highly recommend to all of our cleints that they\r\nadd UM/UIM benefits to their automobile insurance policies.&#160; Insurance\r\npremiums are only slightly increased after adding this type of\r\ncoverage.&#160; If you do not already have UM/UIM coverage, I stongly\r\nrecommend you contact your insurance agent and add it to your policy.</p>\r\n<p>Another consideration for Texas drivers is umbrella coverage.&#160;\r\nUmbrella coverage applies when all available policies of insurance have\r\nbeen exhausted.&#160; For example, if a Texas driver maintains liability\r\ninsurance limits of $100,000, and is involved in a serious car\r\naccident, perhaps a fatality accident, and is determined to be at\r\nfault, the $100,000 policy limits will likely be insufficient to cover\r\nall damages.&#160; Once the $100,000 in benefits have been paid, the\r\numbrella policy would apply, up to the umbrella policy limits.&#160; Adding\r\n$1,000,000 of umbrella insurance coverage generally costs around $300 to\r\n$400 per year.&#160; This is a fairly small price to pay for a significant\r\namount of insurance.</p>"

aS'<p>As the Denver Post Reported:</p><div><div>Electrician Timothy Albo did everything right Saturday night, say family members now posted by his hospital bed at Denver Health waiting for the 26-year-old to awake from a coma.<br /><br />Albo, of Thornton, parked his car at a friend\'s Lower Downtown apartment before hitting the town with some friends. He walked everywhere and planned to spend the night downtown, his brother said. But as the bars let out about 2 a.m. Sunday, authorities said, a dark-colored SUV never stopped after colliding with Albo and a female friend as they crossed 20th Street.<br /><br />Speaking for his tearful family, older brother Rodney Albo pleaded Sunday afternoon with the public for help identifying the driver. &quot;It\'s been really hard for all of us. We know how we were raised, and we don\'t understand&quot; how the driver could leave the scene, Rodney Albo said. &quot;We just want to know. We just want someone to come forward and do the right thing.&quot; Rodney Albo asked anyone who witnessed the hit-and-run or notices a dark SUV with new body damage to the front end or windshield to call the Denver Police Department.</div><div></div><div>Timothy Albo, the youngest sibling in a tightknit family, is listed in critical condition. He suffered a serious head wound and slipped into a coma, his brother said. Authorities declined to identify the second victim, who remains in serious condition. </div><div></div><div>The SUV was last seen traveling westbound on 20th Street, said police spokesman Sonny Jackson. He said it\'s not yet clear whether the sport utility vehicle ran a red light, but the driver committed a crime as soon as he or she fled. Jackson declined to go into greater detail about evidence possibly recovered at the scene but said investigators are hopeful that security cameras in the area may have recorded the collision.</div><div></div><div>About 100 relatives and friends gathered at Denver Health to pray for the recovery of Timothy Albo, expected to undergo an operation to repair damage to his head Sunday afternoon. At a news conference just before the surgery, Rodney Albo &#8212; flanked by his parents, wife and siblings &#8212; described his brother as a young man &quot;well on his way to doing some great things&quot; and &quot;an awesome kid.&quot;<p>By Jessica Fender, to read more, see <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci&#95;16244837" title="The Denver Post">The Denver Post</a></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured, call the law firm of Bell &amp; Pollock, P.C., 303-795-5900 www.bellpollock.com&#160; <a href="http://www.bellpollock.com" title="Denver Injury Attorneys">Denver Injury Attorneys</a>, Champions of the People<a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci&#95;16244837" title="The Denver Post"></a></p></div></div><!--more--><p><b>Hit-and-run in downtown Denver puts 2 pedestrians in hospital&#160;</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured, call the law firm of Bell &amp; Pollock, P.C., 303-795-5900 www.bellpollock.com&#160; <a href="http://www.bellpollock.com" title="Denver Injury Attorneys">Denver Injury Attorneys</a>, Champions of the People</p>'

Many of these riders were following all the rules of the road and then due to a negligent driver they were involved in a fatal crash. \r\nNot all motorcycle accidents are fatal, in many cases the rider is seriously injured and that means hospital bills, surgeries, nursing care, possibly at home and loss of wages. </p><p>This can be financially draining to a family and stressful for the injured motorcycle crash victim.

This means the injuries include traumatic head and spinal cord injuries, broken bones, cuts, scrapes and gashes. </p><p>\r\nThe injuries can take weeks or months to heal and during this time the financial responsibilities including medical bills keep piling up and stress continues to mount.

First responders will be sent, including the police and emergency medical personnel. If neither you nor anyone else involved in the accident has a cell phone or other means of calling for assistance, flag down a passing vehicle and request that they contact help on your behalf. Never, ever leave the scene of an accident before the police arrive, even if the other car involved does or the other driver tells you it is okay. Only when the police officers at the scene tell you that it is okay to leave or medical personnel inform you that it is vital you be transported to the ER immediately should you comply.</p><p><b>Step 2</b>: Cooperate with all first responders.</p><p>Cooperate with the police by providing all requested facts regarding your accident. Don&#8217;t move your car from the position in which it was left after the accident unless the police direct you to do so, even if it is blocking traffic. You should inform anyone else involved in the accident not to move their vehicles either, and inform the police if they did so anyway. </p><p>Allow medical personnel to examine you and answer their questions regarding how you feel as clearly and honestly as possible. If the EMTs want to take you by ambulance to the hospital, let them.</p><p><b>Step 3</b>: Collect information from all parties.</p><p>If you are able to speak to the other people involved in your accident, including witnesses, make sure you get the following information and note it down, if possible:</p><p>*Name of the other driver or witness<br />*Phone numbers, addresses, and any other contact information for the other driver or witness<br />*Other driver&#8217;s insurance policy number, policy provider name, and contact information<br />*Other driver&#8217;s vehicle license plate and registration numbers and driver&#8217;s license number</p><p>Once the police arrive, you&#8217;ll want to make sure to collect their business cards as well, so you can contact them later to request a copy of your accident report.</p><p><b>Step 4</b>: Take photos of the scene or write down description.</p><p>If you have a camera or camera phone handy, the best thing you can do is snap photos of the accident scene. Make sure you include things like skid marks on the road, vehicle damage to your car and any others involved, and anything relevant like road conditions (patches of ice, giant pothole, faulty traffic light, etc.).

aS'Given the volatile and rather frightening state of housing market, many homeowners have been receiving notices from their county tax assessment boards appraising their homes lower than their current mortgages and thus lowering their home taxes. While many people would welcome a little more money into their pockets, some homeowners might be thinking this cannot be a good omen for them or the neighborhood. Hence, the question is whether homeowners should, in general, fight lower tax appraisals. The short answer is no.<p /><p><b><p>REASONS FOR NOT APPEALING LOWER TAX APPRAISALS</p></b><b></b></p><p><b>1. A LOWER APPRAISAL DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN YOUR HOME IS WORTH LOWER</b></p><p>This is important to understand home appraisals are usually conducted en mass on a massive scale. Accordingly, the appraisals do not take into account other factors home purchasers carefully consider for a home purchase. This result leads to home prices appraised lower than what a willing, able and ready purchaser would pay. This means low appraisals would not usually lead to lower home values, generally.</p><p><b>2. A LOWER APPRAISAL LEADS YOUR COUNTY ASSESSOR TO RAISE RATES TO KEEP THEIR BUDGETS CONSISTENT</b></p><p>This is also important to note that not fighting your tax appraisals is not only because you receive lower tax bills, but also because raising your tax appraisals would subject you to pay more than usual in taxes. This paradox is the result of a so called &quot;mileage rate&quot; counties employ every year by which to multiply your assessed tax value. This mileage rate ensures, to a large extent, counties will receive relatively consistent tax dollars. Therefore, since counties lower their appraisals collectively, often for every body, and raise the mileage rate for every body, then even if you are successful at raising your tax appraisal, you end up paying relatively more in taxes.</p><p>&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;</p><p><i><b><a target="&#95;blank" href="http://www.lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Doron%20F,-d-,%20Eghbali.aspx">DORON EGHBALI</a> </b>is a Partner at the Beverly Hills Offices of <a target="&#95;blank" href="http://www.lawadvocategroup.com/">Law Advocate Group, LLP</a>.

Accordingly, if a group with more than 50% common ownership has substantial gross receipts from members without &#8220;substantial nexus&#8221; with Ohio, it may be advantageous to forego a consolidated election, thereby excluding such member(s)&#8217; gross receipts.&#160;</p><p>Unlike combined taxpayers, gross receipts received by one member of a consolidated group from another member are excluded from the group&#8217;s Ohio gross receipts for the CAT. Essentially, Ohio has provided taxpayers with an incentive to elect to file as a consolidated group by excluding intra-group transactions. Further, an interesting situation could arise where certain members of a required combined group can make an 80% consolidated election, with other members of the required combined group having between 80% and 50% common ownership. In this situation, the 80% consolidated taxpayer is entitled to exclude intra-group transactions (remember, limited only to those entities included in the 80% consolidated group). Additionally, the other required combined group members may still be able to avoid CAT obligations if the particular entity has less than 80% common ownership and lacks &#8220;substantial nexus&#8221; with Ohio.&#160;</p>A consolidated election remains effective for eight calendar quarters and automatically renews thereafter for another eight calendar quarters, unless the group notifies the tax commissioner of cancellation of its election.

Sledge v Superior Court (1974) 11 C3d 70, 75, 113 CR 28. The courts of appeal recognized an exception under the former diversion program when the prosecutor&#8217;s eligibility determination involves resolution of factual issues or statutory interpretation, both judicial functions. People v Williamson (1982) 137 CA3d 419, 422, 187 CR 107; People v Paz (1990) 217 CA3d 1209, 1217, 266 CR 468. However, the courts of appeal are in disagreement as to which eligibility determinations involve those judicial functions, particularly regarding whether the determination that there is evidence that a defendant<br />possessed narcotics for sale rendering defendant ineligible under Pen C&#167;1000(a)(3) is a judicial function. The courts in Williamson and People v Venghiattis (1986) 185 CA3d 326, 333, 229 CR 636, held that determining whether a defendant possesses marijuana (in violation of Health &amp; S C &#167;11358) for personal or commercial use involves issues of credibility and the resolution of conflicting inferences&#160; of intended use, and therefore is a function of the trial court. But the courts in People v Brackett (1994) 25 CA4th 488, 500, 30 CR2d 557, and People v McAlister (1990) 225 CA3d 941, 944, 275 CR 229, held that a prosecutor&#8217;s determination that there is evidence of a violation that defendant possessed narcotics for sale does not involve the resolution of conflicting inferences or the determination of credibility, and therefore is not subject to pretrial review. As to the issue of whether an eligibility determination involves statutory interpretation, two cases provide guidance. Thus, a <a href="http://mojavelawyer.com/Lawyer-Profile.html">Mojave Lawyer</a> has asserted that in In People v Paz,supra, the court held that a determination that the defendant had a prior conviction for an offense involving controlled substances is not subject to review as the finding did not involve statutory interpretation or factfinding. In People v Martinsen (1987) 193 CA3d 843, 848, 238 CR 530, the court held that the determination of whether the defendant has successfully completed probation within the meaning of Pen C &#167;1000(a)(4) does involve statutory interpretation requiring a hearing and court examination of defendant&#8217;s record.<!--more-->If the prosecutor determines that the defendant is not eligible for deferred entry of judgment, the defendant&#8217;s sole remedy is a postconviction appeal.

aS'Toyota Recall Law Firm Discusses Toyota\'s Responses At Congressional Hearings; Toyota officials fail to give adequate answers at hearings:<br /><br />It appears as though the much awaited congressional hearings into Toyota&#8217;s three recent recalls have raised more questions than they have answered. The recalls, which now cover over eight million Toyota manufactured automobiles, have come to be known as the &#8220;floor mat recall&#8221;, the &#8220;sticky pedal recall&#8221; and the &#8220;unintended acceleration recall&#8221;.&#160; The recalls began last October with the latest recall being announced just this month.&#160; Regulators and lawmakers alike have been quick to question the automaker giant about when they became aware of the defects, whether the recalls encompass all the affected vehicles and whether or not the announced repairs will actually solve the problem. Hearings held in front of congressional leaders were originally scheduled for earlier this month, however a snow storm delayed the hearings until this week.&#160; The extra time to prepare doesn&#8217;t seem to have provided Toyota officials with satisfactory answers to the Committee&#8217;s questions, says Attorney Emery Brett Ledger.<br /><br />One of the biggest questions appears to be whether the &#8216;fixes&#8221; that Toyota has announced will actually solve the problems.&#160; Toyota officials have repeatedly denied that electronics are to blame for the unintended acceleration problems.&#160; Toyota Motor President Akio Toyoda testified to the congressional panel that electronics were not to blame for the defects, however Toyota&#8217;s U.S. President James Lentz admitted that he wasn&#8217;t sure that the non-electric fix that Toyota had originally announced to solve the problem would actually work.&#160; Congressional leaders ordered testing by an auto engineering professor that ultimately showed that he could defeat the protection that Toyota has implemented to prevent sudden acceleration.&#160; Despite Toyota&#8217;s claim that its own testing shows that the repairs will work, the auto engineer hired by congressional leaders says that Toyota&#8217;s testing did not test for interference from electronics inside the vehicles, from cellular telephones or from airport radar.&#160; Still not convinced after two days of hearings, Congressional leaders, as well as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are continuing to investigate the electronic throttle control system as well as whether electro-magnetic interference is actually to blame for the sudden acceleration problems. <br /><br />For the owners of vehicles affected by the recalls, it appears as though Toyota officials have yet to fully explain, much less fix the problems.&#160; For those that have been involved in an accident as a result of one of the recalled vehicles, the unanswered questions retain even more importance.&#160; If Toyota produced vehicles with defective parts, then they may be held responsible for any damages sustained as a result of those defects.&#160; Under the product liability and personal injury laws of the State of California, a manufacturer will have to compensate a victim for their contribution to an accident and any ensuing injuries.&#160; If you have been involved in an accident and you believe that a defective vehicle was partially or entirely to blame, then contact an experienced California product liability and personal injury lawyer immediately.&#160; Ledger &amp; Associates have attorneys that are experienced in claims involving defective products and can answer any questions you may.&#160; To Learn more : <a href="http://www.ledgerlaw.com/">LedgerLaw</a> or call toll free at 1-800-300-0001.<!--more-->Toyota Recall Attorney Discusses Toyota\'s Responses At Congressional\r\nHearings; Toyota officials fail to give adequate answers at hearings.'

aS'<p /><p>Congresswoman Melissa Bean (D-IL-08) and Congressman Ed Royce (R-CA-40) introduced the National Insurance Consumer Protection Act on April 2, 2009&#160;to create a federal insurance regulator.</p><p>A press release and fact sheet from the Office of Congresswoman Bean are included below:</p><p /><p /><p>Bipartisan National Insurance Consumer Protection Act is vital in wake of AIG meltdown</p><p>Washington, D.C. - Citing the meltdown of insurance giant AIG and the broad crisis in the nation\'s financial system as proof of the vital need for regulatory reform, Congresswoman Melissa Bean (D-IL-08) and Congressman Ed Royce (R-CA-40) introduced the National Insurance Consumer Protection Act on April 2, 2009&#160;to create a robust federal regulator for insurance to act as an alternative to the antiquated, non-uniform system of state insurance regulators currently in operation.</p><p>&quot;The events of 2008 show us that insurance reg reform can no longer be postponed - it is needed now,&quot; Bean said. &quot;This bill will provide consumer protection and choice while eliminating barriers to industry competitiveness in the global market.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never before has the federal government been so invested in an industry it has no regulatory authority over. Leaving the business of insurance regulation solely to the various state insurance commissioners, while the federal government provides taxpayer-funded assistance is simply irresponsible.&quot; Royce said.</p><p>The National Insurance Consumer Protection Act (NICPA) establishes a national system of regulation and supervision for nationally registered insurers, agencies, and producers (agents and brokers) to monitor the systemic risk to the economy from the insurance market, enhance consumer protection and choice, and reduce inefficient regulatory complexity that puts U.S. firms at a competitive disadvantage.&#160; States would maintain responsibility for regulating state-licensed insurers, agencies and producers.</p><p>Major points of the bill include:</p><ul><li>Consumer protections. By creating a world-class regulator, consumers working with a nationally chartered insurer benefit from best practices in consumer protection. The bill directly implements the model laws propagated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners covering consumer protection. A single nationwide telephone number will connect consumers with problems to their local federal or state insurance regulator. The Office of National Insurance will have a physical office and staff in every state through its Division of Consumer Affairs. </li><li>Consumer choice. By eliminating outdated price controls insurance customers across the country will have products more closely reflecting actuarially sound prices available to them. (Illinois, one of the only states without price controls, enjoys lower-than-average insurance rates as insurers compete for customers.) By providing an alternative to the antiquated patchwork of state regulators, nationally chartered insurers will be able to bring new products to market more quickly, providing greater consumer options. </li><li>Risk reduction. NICPA reflects the importance of monitoring the insurance sector for &quot;systemic threats&quot; to the economy and anticipates the need to coordinate with a systemic risk regulator, likely to be created by Congress. The bill calls on this regulator to gather financial data from insurers and affiliates within holding companies, and to consult with the Office of National Insurance to determine the most effective form of functional regulation for systemically important institutions.&#160; Under these provisions, AIG\'s insurance subsidiaries - in addition to its holding companies and non-insurance subsidiaries, like the financial products division - would have been overseen by ONI. </li></ul><p>Insurance reg reform has been recommended in numerous bipartisan reports on financial services modernization, such as the Schumer/Bloomberg report on United States competitiveness, the Treasury Department\'s Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure, and the report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\'s bipartisan commission on capital market competitiveness.&#160; Additionally, Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke have recently noted the systemic gap exploited by AIG and called for a review of our insurance regulations as a critical component of the broad regulatory reform needed to prevent another future collapse of the financial system as occurred in 2008.&#160; During a Senate Budget Committee hearing on March 3 Bernanke stated, &quot;[AIG] made huge numbers of irresponsible bets, took huge losses, there was no regulatory oversight because there was a gap in the system.&quot;&#160; Just last week during a House Financial Services Committee hearing Geithner said, &quot;What we need is better, smarter, tougher regulation, because we\'ve seen the costs of these weaknesses and gaps are catastrophic to the system as a whole.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Beyond the inefficiencies created by the fragmented state-based system overseeing insurance, systemic gaps have revealed themselves in recent months.&#160; Until these gaps are filled, the threat of another AIG remains.&quot; Royce said. &quot;Our legislation will go a long way toward filling those gaps.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The complexity of the modern financial system of insurance conglomerates and holding companies cannot be adequately overseen by the state-based system, as shown by recent events,&quot; Bean said. &quot;Insurance reg reform that protects consumers and investors must be included as Congress moves ahead on comprehensive reg reform of the financial services sector.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/il08&#95;bean/National&#95;Insurance&#95;Consumer&#95;Protection&#95;Act&#95;Fact&#95;Sheet.pdf" mce&#95;href="http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/il08&#95;bean/National&#95;Insurance&#95;Consumer&#95;Protection&#95;Act&#95;Fact&#95;Sheet.pdf">Click here to read a&#160;NICPA fact sheet</a></p><p><a href="http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/il08&#95;bean/h&#95;r&#95;1880.pdf" mce&#95;href="http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/il08&#95;bean/h&#95;r&#95;1880.pdf">Click here to read the full text of the bill</a></p><p>&#160;</p><p>Congresswoman MELISSA BEAN (IL-08) and Congressman ED ROYCE (CA-40)</p><p /><p>National Regulator</p><p>Establishes a parallel, national system of regulation and supervision for insurers, insurance agencies, and insurance producers (agents and brokers), similar to the dual banking system. Insurers, agencies and producers can elect national or state regulation, charters and licenses. States would maintain responsibility of regulating state licensed insurers, agencies and producers.</p><p>The Office of National Insurance</p><p>An independent Office of National Insurance (ONI) is created within the Department of the Treasury, similar to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and its Commissioner would be appointed by the President for a five-year term, subject to th advice and consent of the Senate.</p><p>National Life Insurers and National Property and Casualty Insurers</p><p>NICPA authorizes the National Insurance Commissioner to issue charters for national insurers for life insurance, property and casualty, and reinsurance. The underwriting of life insurance and P/C insurance is separated, but a holding company is permitted to own both a National Life Insurer and a National P/C Insurer.</p><p>National Agencies and National Insurance Producers</p><p>NICPA authorizes the chartering and licensing of national insurance agencies and the licensing of national insurance producers. A national agency would be authorized to sell insurance for any nationally chartered or State licensed insurer. A nationally licensed insurance producer could sell insurance, including surplus lines of insurance, in any State on behalf of any national insurer or a state insurer. Additionally, a State licensed insurance producer could sell insurance on behalf of any insurer, including national insurers, operating within the State in which the producer holds a license.</p><p>Systemic risk</p><p>All insurance commissioners (state and national) would be required to share information with a Systemic Risk Regulator, as defined by the Administration. The Systemic Risk Regulator shall make corrective action recommendations to the Commissioner or state commissioner to take action to mitigate or avoid actions taken by an insurer or affiliate that would have serious adverse effects on economic conditions and financial stability. If action is not taken, the Systemic Risk Regulator with approval of the Coordinating Council for Financial Regulators to circumvent the insurance regulator in emergency circumstances. Finally, if the systemic risk regulator in consultation with the National Insurance Commissioner determines an insurer is systemically important they can require the insurer to be nationally chartered.</p><p>Coordinating Council for Financial Regulators</p><p>Establishes a Coordinating National Council for Financial Regulators based on an expanded version of the President\'s Working Group for Capital Markets. The council shall serve as a forum for financial regulators to collectively identify and consider issues related to the health and competitiveness of the financial services industry. Chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, it shall also include the Commissioner of National Insurance and the heads of the Federal Reserve, SEC, CFTC, OTS, FDIC the Comptroller the Currency, and three state regulators appointed by the President.</p><p>Conversions Between State and National Status</p><p>State licensed insurers would be free to convert to a national charter. Likewise, national insurers would be free to convert to a State charter, subject to approval by the Commissioner.</p><p>Applicable State Law</p><p>The activities and operations of nationally chartered and licensed entities would be primarily subject to federal law. However, national insurers and nationally licensed insurance producers would be subject to certain categories of State law. These categories include: (1) State tax laws; (2) State unclaimed property and escheat laws; (3) State laws related to participation in assigned risk plans and other mandatory residual market mechanisms that are designed to make insurance available to those unable to obtain insurance in the voluntary market; (4) State laws that provide for compulsory coverage of workers\' compensation or motor vehicle insurance; and (5) Participation in state guaranty funds.</p><p>Regulatory and Supervisory Powers</p><p>The Commissioner has a comprehensive set of supervisory and regulatory powers.&#160; National insurers are subject to examinations every two years, and national insurance agencies and national insurance producers are subject to examination in response to a complaint or evidence of a violation of the law or regulations. National insurers, their holding companies, and fellow subsidiaries of their holding companies are subject to risk-based capital standards, investment standards, and asset and liability valuation requirements that are based upon model laws and regulations developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). National insurers are subject to an independent audit committee requirement, limitations on dividends, and limitations on transactions with affiliates.</p><p>Enforcement Powers</p><p>The Commissioner is given enforcement powers patterned after those available to the federal banking agencies, permitting him/her to: (1) revoke or suspend a charter or license; (2) issue a cease and desist order, including an order that mandates affirmative actions, such as the sale of assets or the hiring of new management; (3) remove or suspend individual officers, directors, controlling shareholders, agents and consultants; and (4) impose civil fines of up to $1 million a day for violations of law or regulations or improper conduct.</p><p>Consumer Protection</p><p>NICPA establishes a Division of Consumer Affairs within the Office of National Insurance. The Division of Consumer Affairs shall establish an office of Consumer Affairs in each state with a direct phone number, and shall establish a national toll-free telephone number and website to act upon questions and complaints. The Commissioner will issue market conduct regulations to prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts and practices by all covered entities. These regulations shall implement the model laws of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) regarding consumer protection. The Commissioner is empowered to investigate fraudulent insurance acts, which are defined as federal crimes punishable by up to 10 years in prison.</p><p>Self-Regulatory Organizations</p><p>The Commissioner is authorized to register and oversee self-regulatory organizations for nationally chartered and licensed insurers, agencies and producers. Key powers of the Commissioner, such as chartering and merger and conversion determinations, may not be delegated to a self-regulatory organization.</p><p>Guaranty Fund</p><p>NICPA establishes a National Insurance Guaranty Corporation, which will assume obligations to policyholders, up to limits based on those set by NAIC model laws, when a national insurer is placed into receivership. The corporation shall be funded by assessments on national insurers, based on line of business as needed post action.&#160; National insurers will be required to participate in state guaranty associations for a line of insurance in each State in which such insurer is doing such business. The Director of the National Insurance Guaranty Corporation shall submit a report to Congress within two years on the effectiveness of these provisions.</p><p>Receiverships for Rehabilitation or Liquidation</p><p>The Commissioner may place a national insurer into receivership for rehabilitation or liquidation for a number of circumstances, including the insolvency of a national insurer.</p><p>&#160;</p><!--more--><p>Congresswoman Melissa Bean (D-IL-08) and Congressman Ed Royce (R-CA-40) introduced the National Insurance Consumer Protection Act on April 2, 2009&#160;to create a federal insurance regulator.</p><p>The National Insurance Consumer Protection Act (NICPA) establishes a national system of regulation and supervision for nationally registered insurers, agencies, and producers (agents and brokers) to monitor the systemic risk to the economy from the insurance market, enhance consumer protection and'

aS'It happens quite frequently.  Someone gets hurt at your home or on your property.

You would like to do the right thing and fix the raised concrete slab on your sidewalk so it does not continue to create a tripping hazard for others. Or you are thinking about hiring a contractor to install a handrail for the steps leading up to your deck. However, you are now worried that if you fix the <b><i>unsafe condition</i></b> your efforts will be used against you in court.</p><p>You decide against fixing your property for fear that your actions will be proof that your property was in fact dangerous.  While your concern is a valid one, any repairs you make to your property to fix an <b><i>unsafe condition</i></b> cannot be used against you.</p><p>The <b><i>law in Pennsylvania</i></b> protects property or homeowners who fix an unsafe condition following an <b><i>accident on their property</i></b>.  It is known as the <a title="Subsequent Remedial Measure Rule" href="http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/225/chapter4/s407.html"><b><i>Subsequent Remedial Measure Rule</i></b></a>. It is based on social policy.  Social policy encourages property and homeowners to correct or fix an <b><i>unsafe condition on their property</i></b> after an <b><i>accident </i></b>has occurred.  The reason behind this social policy is clear. It is more important that property owners fix or repair <b><i>property defects</i></b> than have evidence of that repair used against them in a <b><i>premises liability lawsuit</i></b>.</p><p>If evidence of post-accident repairs were admissible in <b><i>property liability lawsuits</i></b>, then property owners would not want to correct the <b><i>dangerous condition </i></b>for fear that in doing so it would be held against them.  In return for excluding this type of evidence, the law encourages property owners to make the necessary repairs following an accident on their property to prevent a similar mishap or accident from occurring again.</p><p>Like a lot of other laws and rules there are some exceptions. If you claim that you do not own the property or do not have any control or right to control the property, but you make post-accident repairs, then that evidence can be used to show you did in fact own the property or have control the property.  For most accidents that occur on residential property, this is not normally an issue.

aS'<p class="MsoNormal">One fifth of all car accidents\r\nthat take place in the United States that have fatal outcome involved a driver\r\nthat is unlicensed or is not a valid driver according to studies done by the\r\nAAA foundation for Traffic Safety. According to statements by members of the\r\nAAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, &#8220;One fatal crash in five involved a driver\r\nwho is not properly licensed. These scofflaws pose a serious threat to\r\nlaw-abiding motorists.&#8221; It is said that drivers who are driving with an invalid\r\nlicense are different from other drivers. Several of these drivers have had\r\nprevious violations, license suspensions or revocations. The violations are\r\nindicative of their poor or unsafe driving behavior.Here in Orange County in southern California this is a big issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Danger of Unlicensed Drivers</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps their license was\r\nrevoked for driving under the influence or for multiple violations for speeding\r\nor any other traffic law violation. These drivers might get back out on the\r\nroad with an invalid license and still commit the same violations putting other\r\ndrivers on the road at high risk for injury or even death if they happen to end\r\nup in a collision with them. Drivers with licenses that are not valid are found\r\nto be much more apt to have been driving while intoxicated or had multiple\r\nsuspensions. In order to stop invalid drivers from driving, one way is to have\r\nvehicle immobilization or impoundment. If they don&#8217;t have a car to drive, then\r\nthey will probably drive less. In places like Gilroy, California and other areas of the golden state this is a big issue. No wonder many of the <a href="http://www.myaeroauto.com">auto repair services in San Diego</a> such as and in bay area body shops have been busy fixing damaged motor vehicles, not to mention the SD legal firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">When a judge takes away a\r\nperson&#8217;s right to drive it is for the safety of the driver himself as well as\r\nother law-abiding drivers on the road. Unfortunately a lot of drives just keep\r\ndriving when they aren&#8217;t supposed to. The accidents that they cause are often\r\nfatal or cause serious injury to innocent victims. If you have been in an\r\naccident with an unlicensed driver and have suffered injuries or a fatality\r\nthen call a wrongful death or car accident attorney to help you in finding out how to get\r\ncompensated in your case in Orange County, CA</p><p class="MsoNormal">That reminds me of how dangerous the roads can be during the holidays, not just at New years but on Thanksgiving as well. \r\n\r\n</p><p class="MsoNormal">The dangers of driving on Thanksgiving are apparent in a car\r\ncrash that involved three separate vehicles traveling on Highway 26 in Boring,\r\nOregon. State police officials reported that a driver of a Toyota 4-Runner was\r\nhit by another driver which caused him to lose control of his car. His\r\n7-month-old son was also in the car at the time that the accident occurred. The\r\ndriver of the Toyota lost control of his car on the slick road. He crossed over\r\nthe median into traffic traveling in the opposite direction and hitting an SUV\r\nwhich spun around and hit a sedan head on and landed sideways on the grass. The\r\npassengers of all vehicles that were involved were injured in the accident and\r\ntransported to the local hospital. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">If you suffered an injury in an automotive accident you believe to\r\nbe caused by someone else then contact a car crash and collision lawyer today to find out\r\nwhat your rights and options are for obtaining compensation. They can also help sort out automobile insurance issues as well.</p>\r\n\r\nAccording\r\nto reports by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Thanksgiving has some of the highest rates of\r\ntraffic accident related fatalities compared to other days in the year. The\r\nholiday is a special time of the year when people attend family gatherings\r\nwhere people end up consuming large amounts of food and alcohol. Many drivers\r\nend up getting behind the wheel when it isn&#8217;t the best idea to do so. Sometimes\r\nthey get in the car late at night to make the drive back home since some have\r\nto work the very next day.

They not only leave permanent physical scars, but psychological scars as well. Following automobile accidents, burn injuries are considered the second leading cause for accidental death, as there are a large fraction of burn injury cases which end up in death.</p><p dir="ltr" /><p dir="ltr">Every single day, there are people who suffer minor burn injuries from minor accidents such as contact with hot oil, and the handling of hot cooking utensils, laboratory experiments, and so on. However, not every of these make it to a court of law. On the other hand, if the injuries or death are caused by the negligence or actions of another party (employer, manufacturer, etc.) it will end up in a personal injury lawsuit.</p><p dir="ltr" /><p dir="ltr">So, when you want to file a claim against another party for your losses and injuries suffered in a burn injury case, you will need to prove that the other party is truly at fault. For example, if you suffered an injury in a fire in tall buildings, you will be eligible to file a claim if the owner of the property or the builder did not comply with government standards for safety.</p><p dir="ltr" /><p dir="ltr">Also, if the personal injury case happened in a school laboratory or a workplace, the school or employer will be at fault if they failed to provide the necessary safety gear. If you yourself neglected to equip yourself with the provided safety gear, sorry to say, you will not be eligible to file a burn injury lawsuit. If your injuries are caused electrocution or malfunction by a defective product, youll have to prove that the product was defective.</p><p dir="ltr" /><p dir="ltr">In any burn injury lawsuit, a qualified and experienced burn injury lawyer will be able to help you in determining the true cause of the injury case, and other factors that will help strengthen your case. If you have suffered any burn injuries, the high-tech treatments you will need to undergo are bound to be costly.</p><p dir="ltr" /><p dir="ltr">With the help of a lawyer well versed in this field, you will be able to obtain due monetary compensation for all the losses you have suffered.

There are only four homes past the private railroad crossing, and Nan Caldwell\'s is one of them. &quot;Sometimes they come by a couple times an hour,&quot; says Caldwell.</p><p>She knows the crossing, which only has a stop sign and a railroad crossing sign, no crossing bars or lights, is dangerous. &quot;You can\'t always hear the train. They don\'t always blow the whistle, because it almost happened to me, and thank God I stopped and saw it because it was right on me,&quot; says Caldwell.</p></blockquote><p>Our thoughts and prayers go out to this young family and their community. Any loss of life from preventable tragedies is unacceptable.</p><p>The Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) engineer claims that he blew the whistle and tried to stop, but that part of his story is disputed one of the pickup truck passengers.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It\'s a tragedy,&quot; he says. &quot;From what my daughter told me, they pulled up on the tracks and nobody had even seen the train. The train didn\'t even blow a whistle, didn\'t blow a horn or nothing.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>According to emergency responders at the scene, the BNSF engineer agreed that Kristy Willis never saw the locomotive before it struck her vehicle.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;He just didn\'t think they seen them, and they just didn\'t have time to stop,&quot; says Captain James Merritt with the Southern Webster County Fire Protection District. The train was moving at about 50 miles an hour. It struck the front driver\'s side of the pickup, killing Willis.</p></blockquote><p>Again, our prayers go out to the Willis family, their neighbors and their community. Tragedies like this don\'t have to happen if the railroad company takes proper precautions. There have been far too many train-vehicle crashes in recent weeks. There were at least two railroad crossing crashes in Missouri -- one in <a href="http://kansascity.injuryboard.com/mass-transit-accidents/man-killed-in-southeast-missouri-train-accident.aspx?googleid=274576" ywaonclickoverride="true">Campbell, Missouri</a> and one in <a href="http://kansascity.injuryboard.com/mass-transit-accidents/two-injured-in-marshall-missouri-train-crash.aspx?googleid=274992" ywaonclickoverride="true">Marshall, Missouri</a> -- just in November.</p><blockquote><p>In fact, Missouri was one of the <a href="http://kansascity.injuryboard.com/mass-transit-accidents/railroad-crossing-accidents-know-the-danger.aspx?googleid=271024" ywaonclickoverride="true">top 10 deadliest states</a> or railroad crossing accidents in 2008.</p></blockquote><p>In addition, Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) has been under heated scrutiny in recent months. In October, BNSF was hit with a <a href="http://kansascity.injuryboard.com/mass-transit-accidents/burlington-norther-sante-fe-railroad-destroys-evidence-in-attempted-cover-up.aspx?googleid=272794" ywaonclickoverride="true">$4 million penalty</a> -- on top of a $21.6 million jury verdict -- because of its &quot;staggering&quot; pattern of misconduct that included destroying evidence in an attempted cover-up of its role in the deaths of four young people who were killed at one of its railroad crossings.</p><blockquote><p>The Court found that BNSF destroyed some evidence, fabricated other evidence, interfered with the investigation and purposefully lied and advanced misleading facts in order to conceal the truth.</p></blockquote><p>BNSF\'s conduct in the Minnesota case was despicable. There conduct in Missouri may not be much better. Reports indicate that BNSF did not properly maintain or guard the crossing and that their engineers did not always sound the train\'s horn at the crossing as federal regulations require.</p><p>Railroad crossing collisions can have any number of causes. Some of these causes include:</p><ul><li>Failure to install proper warnings, such as lights, alarms (crossing bells) or a functioning crossing gate </li><li>Defective warnings -- inoperable lights, bells or gates </li><li>Improper sight lines that prevent a vehicle\'s driver from seeing an oncoming train until it is too late </li><li>Failure to properly maintain the crossing -- such as allowing overgrown trees, vegetation and other foliage to obstruct or hide an oncoming train </li><li>Improperly parking a train at or near a crossing -- this not only hides an oncoming train from view, but gives motorists a false sense of safety in seeing a parked train at the crossing </li><li>Failure to sound the train\'s horn or whistle at or near the crossing </li><li>Other negligence that may appear on the train\'s data recorder or video recorder </li></ul><p>Railroad companies should be held accountable for dangers railroad crossings that kill. Is there a different set of rules for railroad companies than for everyone else? If a railroad has a dangerous crossing where large trains speed through, shouldn\'t they warn approaching motorists? Why did the railroad never put up a proper warning device?</p><p>You can learn more about how to protect yourself at railroad crossings by visiting our <a href="http://kansascity.injuryboard.com/mass-transit-accidents/" ywaonclickoverride="true" ywaonclickoverride="true">railroad safety blog</a> or <a href="http://www.langdonemisontrainaccident.com/" ywaonclickoverride="true" ywaonclickoverride="true">web site</a>.</p><p>Learn more and become a fan of <a href="http://www.langdonemison.com/" ywaonclickoverride="true" ywaonclickoverride="true">Langdon &amp; Emison</a> on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#/pages/Lexington-MO/Langdon-Emison-Trial-Attorneys/96033299425?ref=ts" ywaonclickoverride="true" ywaonclickoverride="true">Facebook</a>.</p><!--more-->You can learn more about how to protect yourself at railroad crossings by visiting our <a href="http://kansascity.injuryboard.com/mass-transit-accidents/" ywaonclickoverride="true" ywaonclickoverride="true">railroad safety blog</a> or <a href="http://www.langdonemisontrainaccident.com/" ywaonclickoverride="true" ywaonclickoverride="true">web site</a>.'

Money and children change hands, and emotions are bent, broken, and assuaged. </p><p>Dealing with divorce is hard, unpleasant work. You once loved the person you are now divorcing. That relationship never ends&#8212;it only changes, regardless of the presence of children. </p><p>Just as you had a choice to marry, you have a choice about how to deal with divorce. Hurt, anger, and fear are understandable, but they can also make the divorce process difficult. Even with the help of good divorce attorneys, your behavior&#8212;and that of your partner&#8212;largely determine the success of your divorce. Even if considering divorce, it is not too late to try <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/marriage-counseling/MY00839/METHOD=print" target="&#95;blank">counseling</a> to discuss issues or to seek an amicable separation. </p><p><b>Doing divorce right</b></p><p>If you decide to divorce, take steps to keep yourself, your children, and your spouse out of a contentious divorce battle.

If you can agree with your spouse on the issues, retain an experienced divorce attorney to review and prepare your Settlement Agreement and other necessary court documents.</li><li><b>Children and divorce</b>: If you have children, keep quarreling to a minimum and work with your spouse to emotionally and financially support your children through the process.</li></ul><p><b>Contact us</b></p><p>Despite best efforts, divorce is difficult.

The best step to take is to hire a personal injury lawyer. Personal injury lawyers can be categorized into car, truck or even motorbike accident lawyers. And these are only a few of their specializations. If you need any legal help, it is a good idea to hire as early as possible to avoid any costly mistakes.</p><p /><p>The responsibility of a personal injury lawyer is to help you find your way through hard times that may arise due to an accident. With an excellent car accident lawyer, you would be able to recover the losses you have incurred from a motor vehicle accident. Besides that, the heavy amount of paperwork and the hassle one have to go through for insurance claims can also be minimized greatly.</p><p>Speaking of insurance claims, always bear in mind that an accident lawyer is important when you speak to an insurance adjuster, because an insurance adjuster is never on your side. The adjusters&#8217; goal is to promote the insurance company&#8217;s bottom line by giving you as little as possible after your car accident. Insurance adjusters will hardly inform you if you have any added reimbursement or coverage should you go to other companies. Not to worry, even trucks and motorbikes accidents have lawyers to minimize the hassle one has to go through.</p><p>With a personal injury lawyer, compensation to cover any losses such as medical expenses, burn injuries, or lost wages can be done thoroughly. The sooner you have a contact with your auto accident lawyer, the better. This is because the possibilities of medical bill payments and covering lost wages are always present. A person should contact a car accident lawyer shortly after the accident occurs for the best results.</p><p /><p>For example, riding a bike is undoubtedly not as safe as driving a car. Motorcycle accidents can be devastating because riders are provided with very little protection. The most vital rule after being involved in a motorcycle accident is to engage the services of a motorcycle accident attorney. It is very important to contact an auto accident attorney when you do not know how to prove your losses, or when you need to make your claim or when insurance companies have rejected your claim or if you think they have mistakenly rejected your claim. If you think there is a remote chance that you will need legal advice in regards to the consequences of the accident that you had, then it is imperative that you engage the services of a personal injury lawyer for help</p><p>Law Offices of Ledger &amp; Associates<br />811 Wilshire Blvd<br />Suite 1000<br />Los Angeles, CA 90017<br />Office: 213-493-6588<br />Toll Free 800-300-0001<br />Website: <a href="http://www.ledgerlaw.com/">LedgerLaw</a></p>'

The rule allows defense\r\nattorney&#8217;s to make an argument on paper that a criminal charge should be\r\ndismissed based on a lack of evidence that a crime occurred. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>Mary gets pulled over for running a\r\nstop sign. Mary is driving and Tom, her friend is a passenger. The car is\r\nregistered to Bill, Mary&#8217;s dad.

The Officer located cocaine underneath the passenger\r\nseat concealed in a tin box. The tin box was also completely concealed under\r\nthe seat. Both Mary and Tom tell the officer that they had no idea that the\r\ncocaine was in the vehicle and it does not belong to them. The Officer charges\r\nMary with Possession of Cocaine and the State Attorney&#8217;s Office proceeds with\r\nprosecution for the alleged crime.<p></p><p></p>Florida\r\nlaw requires that the a charging agency such as the State attorney&#8217;s Office\r\nprove &#8220;knowledge&#8221; of the drugs in order to prove a possession charge such as\r\nMary&#8217;s Possession of Cocaine charge. A C-4 motion allows the defense attorney\r\nto list the undisputed facts surrounding Mary&#8217;s charge: The car was registered\r\nto someone else, the cocaine was concealed and Mary says she did not know about\r\nthe cocaine. The State Attorney&#8217;s office would likely not be able to dispute\r\nthese facts and a judge would likely grant the Motion to dismiss because there\r\nare no disputed facts and the state cannot establish a prima facie case of\r\nguilt against Mary because they cannot prove that she knew about the drugs.&#160; &#160;&#160;\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If the\r\nState Attorney&#8217;s Office does dispute the facts, they can file a traverse or\r\ndemurrer indicating there are disputed facts and a judge will determine if the\r\nC-4 Motion should or should not prevail. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; By\r\nusing a C-4 motion, a defense attorney can attempt to achieve a dismissal of a\r\ncase in lieu of further litigation.

aS'<p><u>State v. Moua Her</u> is the case blog of the day.  This is an older case that has come back for some revisions to case law after <u>Giles v. California</u>.  Mr. Her was originally charged with First Degree Domestic Abuse, Murder.  After a jury trial in Ramsey County, Mr. Her was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.</p>  <p>The problem arose out of the fact that Ms. Vang (Moua Her&#8217;s wife) had previously made statements to a police officer.  During the jury trial those statements were admitted against Mr. Her on the grounds that Mr. Her had waived his right to confront Ms. Vang by killing her.  (Anyone else see the Catch 22 with that statement?).  Thus the Minnesota Supreme Court rejected Mr. Her&#8217;s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause appeal and held that the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing doctrine applied.</p>  <p>The problem was further complicated when the United States Supreme Court decided <u>Giles v. California</u>.  In Giles, the Supreme Court held that the State must show, not only that the defendant was responsible for the killing, but also that he committed the killing with the intent of preventing the victim from testifying against the defendant.  In Minnesota, as in California before <u>Giles</u>, the State only needed to show that the defendant intended to kill the victim, not that the intent was to keep them from testifying.</p>  <p>Because the Minnesota Supreme Court did not make a ruling on whether Mr. Her intended to prevent Ms. Vang from testifying (in fact they originally held it didn&#8217;t matter based on Minnesota precedent), the question of whether Mr. Her&#8217;s Sixth Amendment rights were violated is still in question.</p>  <p>The end result is that <u>State v. Moua Her</u> has been remanded to the District Court level for hearings to determine if Mr. Her&#8217;s Sixth Amendment rights were violated in light of <u>Giles</u>.</p>  <p>Please remember that the interpretation and analysis presented here is not intended to be legal advice.

aS'A lot of my clients talk with their spouses directly about settlement of divorce disputes. &#160;Many times my clients want to know what to say. &#160;I have developed a simple script for them to follow. &#160;The simplicity is important, because they need to be able to remember the script under pressure.&#160;Here it is:<br color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Trebuchet MS\', Trebuchet, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; background-color: rgb(220, 212, 203); " /><ol color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Trebuchet MS\', Trebuchet, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; background-color: rgb(220, 212, 203); "><li padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.25em; margin-left: 0px; "><b>Give only 20% information and try to get 80%.</b>&#160;Information is power.

aS"&#160; Recently, Illinois amended its law regarding the expungement of \r\nnon-violent offenses effective January 1, 2013. A new provision called \r\nthe Offender Initiative Program 730 ILCS 5/5-6-3.3 would allow persons \r\nwho had not been previously convicted of or placed on probation or \r\nconditional discharge for a felony&#160; and who are charged with certain \r\nprobationable non-violent offenses such as theft, retail theft, burglary\r\n or possession of a controlled substance, the ability to participate in a\r\n program which would eventually allow for expungement of the arrest.

aS'<p>When sharing North Georgia&#8217;s road with trucks&#8212;whether dump trucks hauling dirt across town or big rigs, transporting cargo across the country,&#160; auto drivers need to be alert and cautious.</p><p>Operators of heavy trucks require more time to reach a full stop than passenger cars. If a car&#8212;which weighs an average of 5,000 pounds&#8212;is traveling 55 miles per hour, it can reach a full stop within 130 to 140 feet. Contrast trucks, a big rig&#8212;which can legally weigh up to 80,000 pounds in the United States without an overweight or oversize permit&#8212;will require about 400 feet before it can come to a full stop. Clearly, a multi-ton tractor trailer truck cannot go from highway speeds to zero in a split second. </p><p>A second factor that plays a role in stopping and slowing a large tractor/trailer is the amount of time it takes the operator to respond. To reach an appropriate speed, a trucker might have to switch through ten gears as well as apply the breaks. Beyond gear switching and breaking, another delay to stopping is the driver&#8217;s perception and reaction time. Depending on the individual driver, it will likely take at least three-quarters of a second before processing the fact that he or she needs to reduce speed. A trucker, therefore, might cover over 100 feet before recognizing that it&#8217;s time to hit the brakes.&#160; </p><p>If traveling conditions are dangerous&#8212;such as from slick roads or weather conditions that impede visibility&#8212;the lead time between initiating a stop to stopping can double. Under ideal circumstances, for instance, it takes a car traveling 55 miles per hour about 4.6 seconds to stop. If it&#8217;s snowy, the time needed to stop increases to over ten seconds. The average 18-wheeler is also between 70 and 80 feet long, so jackknifing&#8212;a situation in which the tires lose traction so that the cab and the trailer, no longer in accord, form a V or L shape&#8212;is also a possibility when a driver swerves or breaks suddenly to avoid a collision.</p><p>Keeping in mind that a big rig will need 400 feet to stop under ideal conditions, safety advocates strongly recommend applying the three-second rule to determine the minimal distance a driver should maintain between his or her vehicle and the one ahead. By waiting three seconds from the time the rear of the vehicle in front of you passes a certain point before your front bumper reaches that same marker, you will have a 243-foot safety zone between you and the other vehicle if you are traveling at 55 miles per hour. If you use a six-second benchmark, you&#8217;ll place 486 feet between you and the other vehicle.&#160; A truck operator, therefore, should use the higher benchmark favoring safety and protection of life and property.</p><p>Clearly, the faster the flow of traffic, the greater the distance must be between cars and trucks in order to maintain a reasonably safe distance. Around Metropolitan Atlanta, where speeds are relatively high and highways are busy, cautious drivers will find it nearly impossible to stay a comfortable distance away from trucks that accompany them on the road.&#160; Consequently, accidents that result from following too closely [rear-enders] regularly occur.</p><p>If you or someone you know has been seriously harmed as a result of a trucking accident on Georgia&#8217;s congested roads, we strongly recommend that you seek the advice of a qualified personal injury attorney who knows Georgia laws and fully understands the long-term implications of injury caused by trucks.

aS'<p>Today\'s housing market is rough. The house next door to mine is currently for sale for<br />1/3 the price I paid for my home in 2004. But despite the slump and the fact<br />that my home is extremely underwater, my home is important to me. It is where I<br />raise my young son and teenage nephew. For many individuals today the bad<br />economy combined with the terrible housing market has led them to walk away<br />from their homes. But for many more, their home is something they want to save<br />despite the hardships that saving it will impose. For many of these individuals<br />a Chapter 13 Reorganization is the best way to save their home.</p><p>How Chapter 13 Works:</p><p>A Chapter 13 Bankruptcy is designed to allow you to set up a plan to pay back<br />your debt over the course of three to five years. During this time you will<br />catch up any secured debt you are behind on, pay any priority debt such as<br />taxes and child support, and pay off your unsecured debt at some portion of<br />what you owe based on what you can afford.</p><p>This Chapter 13 Plan is not negotiated with your creditors. Your creditors are not<br />required to vote on or approve the plan and participation is not voluntary. The<br />Chapter 13 Plan is created by you in conjunction with your attorney and is<br />submitted to the court for approval. While your creditors have the right to<br />object to the plan they must do so using a legal argument and cannot disagree<br />merely on principle. Objections by creditors are common and are dealt with<br />either by giving additional information to the creditor, by negotiating some language<br />they would like to see in the plan, or by going before the judge and letting<br />him rule on the objection. The creditor does not have the right to force you to<br />make any changes to the plan.</p><p>Once the plan has been approved by the court, the debtor must continue to make the<br />court approved payments for the length of the plan. If any changes occur, the<br />individual must keep their attorney informed as he may be able to make changes<br />to help the clients plan succeed.</p><p>After all payments under the plan have been received the court will evaluate the case<br />to determine if all elements of the plan have been complied with. If the Debtor<br />has done everything that the court has asked of them then he will receive a<br />discharge of all his unsecured debt and his secured debt will be deemed<br />current.</p><p>Lien Stripping:</p><p>Many individuals fall behind on their mortgage payments for some reason other than<br />the affordability of the first mortgage payment. Some of these individuals<br />cannot afford their credit card debts. For others it may be auto deficiencies.<br />But for a great deal of individuals the reason they fall behind on their first<br />mortgage payment is that they are struggling with a second or third mortgage<br />that is weighing them down. For many of these individuals a lien strip is<br />available to help ease their burdens and save their home. A lien strip, which<br />is only available in a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy, is an adversary proceeding filed within<br />a bankruptcy case which is used to show the court that all of the equity in<br />your home is consumed by the debt owed to the first mortgage company. If you<br />can prove that no equity remains for the second, third or fourth mortgage to<br />attach to then these mortgages are removed from your property and paid back as<br />unsecured debt for pennies on the dollar.</p><p>Example Client 1:</p><p>Before Filing</p><p>Income:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

aS'<p>While most people who are not familiar with Southern California would\r\n assume that since the communities in the area are so spread out that no\r\n one would prefer to travel on foot. However, anyone who has spent any \r\ntime in San Diego County understands that pedestrians are a regular if \r\nnot a constant sight. The weather, the scenery and the geography all \r\nconspire to make San Diego a walker&#8217;s paradise and an extremely popular \r\nform of travel and exercise. Unfortunately, this popularity also leads \r\nto a high number of <a title="San Diego County pedestrian accidents" href="http://www.mglawyers.com/index.php">San Diego County pedestrian accidents</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Below you will find a brief overview of the statistics that relate to\r\n the number of San Diego County pedestrian accidents that occur on an \r\nannual basis throughout the county. You will also find information \r\nregarding the legal rights and options possessed by someone who has been\r\n harmed in this manner. Anyone who has been injured in a pedestrian \r\naccident needs to obtain the help of experienced San Diego personal \r\ninjury lawyers as soon as possible.</p>\r\nSan Diego County Pedestrian Accident Statistics\r\n<p>When one reviews the statistics regarding San Diego County pedestrian\r\n accident statistics, it doesn&#8217;t take long for such a person to realize \r\nthe scope of the problem. Specifically, more than 400 people are injured\r\n in these types of crashes in the county every year, and more than 75 \r\npeople are killed. Broken down further, more than one person is injured \r\nevery single day in these crashes and three people are killed every two \r\nweeks. The vast majority of these crashes involve collisions between \r\npedestrians and motor vehicles of different shapes and sizes.</p>\r\nThe Legal Aftermath of a San Diego County Pedestrian Accident\r\n<p>When someone is injured in a San Diego County pedestrian accident, \r\nthat person is immediately forced into a situation where he or she must \r\nfight for several forms of recovery. Most obviously, a person in this \r\nposition needs to fight for a physical and perhaps an emotional \r\nrecovery. In addition, this person must fight to protect his or her \r\nlegal rights in order to avoid total financial ruin.</p>\r\n<p>One of the best ways to make sure that a person who has been harmed \r\nin this manner is protecting his or her legal rights is by filing a <a title="California personal injury lawsuit" href="http://www.mglawyers.com/index.php">California personal injury lawsuit</a>\r\n against the person responsible for his or her injuries.

Two weeks ago, in Resistencia, Argentina, twenty minutes after <strong>Analia Bouter </strong>had given birth to a three months premature baby girl, she and her husband <strong>Fabian Veron</strong>\r\n were handed a death certificate and told that their daughter was \r\nstillborn. The couple began to mourn the loss of their fifth child. \r\n<p>About twelve hours later, Analia insisted that she see the infant one\r\n last time to say good-bye. Analia and Fabion were brought to the morgue\r\n where their daughter lay in a small coffin. Fabion pryed the coffin \r\nopen and Analia peeked inside. What happened next can only be described \r\nas the stuff of miracles. Fabion and Analia?s daughter softly cried out.\r\n Then, she began to move. She was <strong>alive</strong> after 12 hours \r\nin a refrigerated morgue; after being declared dead by 5 separate \r\nmedical professionals in the delivery room. Analia and Fabio collapsed \r\nin joy and worker in the morgue lifted the baby and confirmed that she \r\nwas alive.

She suspected that her Husband was having an affair, and that, along with other issues, prompted this meeting.  While she had her suspicions, she did not have any specific proof and wanted some information on things to do.</p><p>   One of her thoughts was to have a GPS device hidden in or on his car to track where he went.  It seemed that there were significant periods of time where the husband would &quot;disappear&quot; and she wanted to know where he was.  </p><p>   This method of investigation sounds like a great idea except for one fact.  In Michigan, it is illegal to place a GPS device on a vehicle without the owners knowledge and consent.  In fact, it is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 1 year in jail and/or a fine of up to $1000.00.</p><p>   So, she asked me, what if the Husband did not own the car.  Well, the statute further prohibits the tracking of the location of a motor vehicle without the consent and knowledge of either the owner of the car or the authorized operator of that vehicle.</p><p>   There are exceptions according to Michigan statutes and, in fact, a professional investigator can place a device on a car, but only in limited circumstances.

aS"<p>The vehicle for transfer of an ownership interest in a small business is usually called a buy-sell agreement.&#160; The name of the agreement, however,&#160;barely begins to describe the various benefits that&#160;it can bring to the owners of the business.&#160; Since most small businesses often pay out most or all of their profits in salaries, an equity interest in the business would be much less valuable if its owner was not assured of being able to sell that interest back to the business or to other shareholders. With professional advice,&#160;a buy-sell&#160;agreement can be tailored to meet the objectives of each small business.&#160; Unfortunately, money is an issue in the organization of most small businesses and the buy-sell agreement is either an afterthought or something that the owners put off as something they will do when the business begins to generate a profit.&#160; More often than not, the owners wait too long and then&#160;one of the three &quot;Big D's&quot;&#160;happens (death, disability or divorce&#160;of an owner), and then it's too late.</p><p>So now you have the buy-sell agreement.&#160; What about the valuation of the interests covered by the agreement when&#160;a &quot;triggering event&quot; occurs?&#160;&#160;How do the owners place&#160;a dollar value on the interest to be purchased?&#160; How do you do that with an entity (for example a closely held corporation) whose stock, by its very nature, has little or no liquidity?&#160; Enter one of the real benefits of the buy-sell agreement.&#160; The agreement can set the price for the shares according to a predetermined formula agreed to by the owners prior to the triggering event.&#160;&#160;The formula can be as varied as the value shown on the company's books, the value arrived at by a third-party appraisal, or some other valuation method.&#160; Once the valuation method is selected, it is important that the value be revisited regularly (at least annually,&#160;and not less often than every other year) so that it remains current.</p><p>A buy-sell agreement may also serve as an orderly method for maintaining control over the company despite a change in the composition of the owners.&#160; In a family run business, it is important that a departing owner's interest be purchased by those that will continue the business.&#160; For children who decide that they do not want to carry on in the business, cash, perhaps generated by an insurance policy on a senior owner, might be an alternative to inheriting part of the business.&#160; Regardless, shareholders should avoid conflicts between the terms of the buy-sell agreement and their Wills.&#160; When the terms of the Will and the agreement cannot be reconciled, the odds for litigation increase, defeating the smooth transition that was anticipated in the first place with the preparation of the buy-sell agreement.&#160; If a Will predates the agreement, it may be necessary to draft a new Will that is consistent with the agreement (should contain a provision that business interests are to be disposed of in accordance with the terms of the buy-sell agreement).</p><p>A properly drafted buy-sell agreement, like any good contract, can avoid future disputes by establishing agreed rights and duties.&#160; Think twice about further delaying the preparation of this important document.</p><p /><p />"

When a breach of that duty causes injury to another, the law imposes liability on the negligent person, who is required to compensate the injured person for the harm caused, including property damage, present and future medical expenses, lost wages, pain, and suffering.</p><p><strong>Common Personal Injury Law Misconceptions</strong></p><p>A <a href="http://www.vancouver-personal-injury.com/" target="&#95;blank">Vancouver injury lawyer</a> can help you to separate the misconceptions from the facts.&#160; Here are some examples of misconceptions that many people have about personal injury lawsuits: </p><ul><li><b>I do not need an attorney to settle my case.</b> While you are not required to retain an attorney, it is advisable to do so for many reasons.

The answer is NO. When you claim your weeks for unemployment you\r\nhave to declare under oath that you have the ability to work and that you are\r\navailable to work and that you are not claiming Social Security. If... you\r\nclaim both, the unemployment office will send you an overpayment letter\r\nrequiring you to pay back every penny. DO NOT CLAIM UNEMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL\r\nSECURITY AT THE SAME TIME. IF YOU ARE DISABLED, YOUR DISABILITY PRECLUDES YOU\r\nTO WORK. If you do not pay the overpayment or you choose to ignore it the\r\nUnemployment Office can refer it as a criminal matter to the State Attorney\'s\r\nOffice and they could press charges against you.

aS'<div id="body">\r\n\t\t<p>If you\'re trying to head off a foreclosure, you\r\nwill need to make the loan current. To make the loan current, you would\r\nneed to pay all delinquent amounts. This will probably include all\r\ncosts and fees the mortgage company was subject to in order to process\r\nof foreclosure.</p><p>Sometimes lenders are willing to allow you a\r\nperiod of time to address your situation if they think it\'s possible\r\nthey can avoid taking over your property through foreclosure. Many\r\npeople would benefit from credit counseling or debt consolidation\r\nbefore it gets to this point.</p><p>The lender may accept a proposal to\r\nget the property sold---and you may be able to save your equity. Often,\r\nthere is no equity, and the lender may work with you to allow a Short\r\nSale. This means they will take less than the full payoff on the loan.</p><p>In\r\nsome situations the lender will accept an agreement in which you agree\r\nto keep current on your loan in the future--and you agree to a\r\nrepayment plan on delinquent amounts.\r\n<br />To avoid foreclosure, let your lender know immediately that you\r\nwill solve the problem so they can avoid the process and results of a\r\nforeclosure.</p><p>You can also try to refinance the loan. There are\r\nnumerous reports out there that lenders make it nearly impossible to\r\nget their help to avoid foreclosure. It seems a mystery that has no\r\ngood reason behind it. The lender is usually left with whatever the\r\nproceeds are that result from a sale after acquiring the property. It\r\nis a wonder that they aren\'t more helpful in many cases. Here\'s the big\r\nquestion on the minds of many:</p><p>What will a Foreclosure Do to my Credit?\r\n<br />Certainly a foreclosure is the most destructive event your credit\r\nstatus can sustain. It is even worse than declaring bankruptcy. A\r\nforeclosure on your credit record will hurt your ability to borrow\r\nmoney for years. So it is usually more than worth it to head of\r\nforeclosure. Credit counseling or debt relief could be a better\r\nalternative in this case.</p><p>Be aware of the burgeoning scams out\r\nthere where people will try to tell you that they can solve your\r\nmortgage problem real quick and easy. Always keep in mind the old adage\r\nthat; if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p><p>The\r\nscammers may try to tell you to sell your property fast. Their aim is\r\nto get your equity. Sometimes they\'ll offer a small amount of money.\r\nThis is a tip off that they are after your equity. Never sign the deed\r\nto the property to another party. They may tell you that you can stay\r\nin the home and pay &quot;rent&quot; to them and a continuing resolution can be\r\nworked out.</p><p>This is the worst thing you can do because even if\r\nyou sign over the deed-you are is still responsible for the loan. The\r\nscammer almost never makes the mortgage payments and you will still be\r\nsubject to foreclosure.</p><p>It is tough to take the calls or letters\r\nfrom your mortgage company, especially when a foreclosure process has\r\nbegun. Usually the lender does not want to get stuck with your property\r\nthrough foreclosure. They want their money. So keep in mind they would\r\nprefer to avoid foreclosure. Be honest about your circumstances and ask\r\nthem to work with you to find options. As with any potentially\r\nproblematic business or legal situation, be sure to keep notes of all\r\nconversations you have with the lender. Write down dates and times of\r\ncalls, the name of whoever you talked to, and note the details what was\r\nsaid.</p>\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class="sig" id="sig">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Michael Ehline is a writer/researcher of numerous topics including legal, <a href="http://www.commcredit.org/" target="&#95;new">credit counseling</a>,\r\ndebt consolidation, debt help and relief, as well as personal injury\r\nattorney related issues such as fraud, wrongful death, and&#160;<a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/" target="&#95;new"></a><a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/">motorcycle accidents in Los Angeles</a>, California, causing serious injuries.</p><p>Ehline Law | <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/pages/4092/san-francisco-personal-injury-attorney.htm" title="san francisco accident injury attorney">Accident Injury Attorney</a><br /> 633 West Fifth Street, 28th Fl<br /> Los Angeles, CA 90701 <br /> 213-596-9642</p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p margin-bottom: 1em;">Article Source:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Michael&#95;Ehline">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thttp://EzineArticles.com/?expert=Michael&#95;Ehline\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p><!--more-->Although a <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/pages/3448/los-angeles-personal-injury-lawyers.htm" title="los angeles personal injury attorney">personal injury attorney in Los Angeles</a> can help you with a catastrophic accident, a <a href="http://www.commcredit.org/">credit counselor</a> is what you need when your credit is injured.&#160; <a href="http://www.commcredit.org/aboutus.jsp">Learn about credit counseling</a> and what happens generally with foreclosure.'

aS"While infidelity of a spouse during marriage is often the reason that the other spouse decides to file for a divorce, it is not always considered as a factor in the ensuing legal proceedings. The role that infidelity plays depends upon the laws of the state that has jurisdiction over the matter. Adultery is considered as a cause for a divorce in a number of states, but many states including Florida have abolished fault as a ground for divorce. \r\n\r\nIn no-fault states a spouse seeking a divorce has no obligation to prove that the other spouse did anything wrong. However, if the unfaithful behavior of a spouse has an effect on the well-being of a couple's children, it will often be taken into account in child custody decisions where the judge is obligated to consider the best interests of the children. It can also be a factor in property division orders if it can be shown that the unfaithful spouse has intentionally dissipated marital assets. \r\n\r\nContinue reading: http://www.forrestesq.com/blog/2013/10/infidelity-and-divorce.shtml"

The faxes were sent to accountants advising them of various aspects of the law which were pertinent to accounting. Over 8,400 faxes went out. At trial he was ordered to pay statutory damages of $500 for each fax, for a total of $4.2 million. On appeal the lawyer contended 75% of the fax content was informational and only 25% of the content alerted recipients to his availability for services.&#160; Therefore, he argued the faxes were not advertisements.

aS'<p dir="ltr">\tAgain a judge renders an uninteresting decision using an interesting rationale.&#160;</p><p /><p>\tIn the case of&#160;<em>Damankah v. Damankah</em>&#160;(CL-09-000345), the Salem Circuit Court determined that husband&#8217;s student loan debt acquired during the marriage and prior to the final separation of the parties was marital debt subject to apportionment under Virginia Code &#167; 20-107.3.&#160; The court then apportioned the entire debt to husband.&#160; The court held:</p><p>\t&#8220;Although testimony was presented in the instant case that a portion of the student loan was used directly for family living expenses, no evidence was presented as to what portion of the loan was spent for those expenses.&#160; Husband contends that the entire loan was for marital purposes because part was used directly for living expenses and part to enable him to increase his earnings for the benefit of his family.&#160; He concludes, therefore, that it is a marital debt.&#160; Wife denies that.&#160; The Court cannot guess or speculate as to the facts of a case or the actual division or expenditure of loan proceeds.&#160; The student loan debt solely in Husband\'s name was obviously used, at least in part, for the direct support of the family, and it did increase Husband\'s earnings.&#160; Considering the limited evidence before&#160; the&#160; Court,&#160; the&#160; factors&#160; set&#160; forth&#160; in&#160; &#167;&#160; 20-107.3(E),&#160; Code&#160; of&#160; Virginia&#160; (1950),&#160; as amended,&#160; especially those&#160; factors&#160; dealing with the length of&#160; this marriage, the health of&#160; the&#160; parties,&#160; the&#160; actual&#160; grounds&#160; for&#160; divorce,&#160; Husband\'s&#160; stated&#160; but&#160; unproven&#160; reason&#160; for leaving&#160; the&#160; family,&#160; the&#160; disparity&#160; in&#160; education,&#160; the&#160; original&#160; purpose&#160; of&#160; the&#160; loan,&#160; the lifetime benefits to be&#160; received from that debt by Husband, the present and future earning potential&#160; of&#160; Husband and Wife and the disparity therein, the Court finds&#160; that Husband\'s student loan has been proven to be marital property.&#160;&#160; For the reasons set forth herein, the Court&#160; finds&#160; that&#160; the&#160; debt&#160; should be paid in&#160; full&#160; by&#160; Husband,&#160; the&#160; same&#160; as&#160; if&#160; it&#160; were&#160; his separate debt.&#160; No&#160; portion&#160; of&#160; it&#160; will&#160; be&#160; assigned&#160; to&#160; the&#160; Wife,&#160; and&#160; neither party will&#160; be required to pay an equitable distribution award to the other.&#8221;</p><p /><p>\tThat the court apportioned the entire student loan debt to husband is not surprising given the facts recited above, particularly that the marriage lasted no more than 8 years prior to the marital separation and that the husband alone would benefit from his education moving forward.&#160; That the court determined that the student loan debt was marital debt in the first instance is also not surprising, considering it was incurred during the marriage and used for clearly marital purposes.&#160; The interesting nuance is that the court bothered to look at the factors under Va. Code &#167; 20-107.3(E) to help him determine that the student loan debt was marital.&#160;</p><p /><p>\tThe Virginia Code&#8217;s language defining separate and marital debts is relatively straightforward.&#160; Virginia Code &#167; 20-107.3(A)(4) and (5) state:</p><p>&#8220;4. Separate debt is (i) all debt incurred by either party before the marriage, (ii) all debt incurred by either party after the date of the last separation of the parties, if at such time or thereafter at least one of the parties intends that the separation be permanent, and (iii) that part of any debt classified as separate pursuant to subdivision A 5. However, to the extent that a party can show by a preponderance of the evidence that the debt was incurred for the benefit of the marriage or family, the court may designate the debt as marital.</p><p>5. Marital debt is (i) all debt incurred in the joint names of the parties before the date of the last separation of the parties, if at such time or thereafter at least one of the parties intends that the separation be permanent, whether incurred before or after the date of the marriage, and (ii) all debt incurred in either party\'s name after the date of the marriage and before the date of the last separation of the parties, if at such time or thereafter at least one of the parties intends that the separation be permanent. However, to the extent that a party can show by a preponderance of the evidence that the debt, or a portion thereof, was incurred, or the proceeds secured by incurring the debt were used, in whole or in part, for a nonmarital purpose, the court may designate the entire debt as separate or a portion of the debt as marital and a portion of the debt as separate.&#8221;</p><p /><p>\tThe student loan debt in this case was incurred in husband&#8217;s name after the date of the marriage and before the date of the last separation of the parties.&#160; The court apparently received no evidence suggesting that the student loan debt was used for a nonmarital purpose.&#160;&#160; Instead, the student loan debt was used to finance the husband&#8217;s education and pay some living expenses.&#160; So the student loan debt was clearly marital debt under Va. Code &#167; 20-107.3(A)(5).&#160;</p><p /><p>\tNevertheless, the court looked at Va. Code &#167; 20-107.3(E) in determining whether the student loan debt was marital or separate debt.&#160; That section states:</p><p> &#8220;E. The amount of any division or transfer of jointly owned marital property, and the amount of any monetary award, the apportionment of marital debts, and the method of payment shall be determined by the court after consideration of the following factors:</p><p> 1. The contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family;</p><p> 2. The contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party in the acquisition and care and maintenance of such marital property of the parties;</p><p> 3. The duration of the marriage;</p><p> 4. The ages and physical and mental condition of the parties;</p><p> 5. The circumstances and factors which contributed to the dissolution of the marriage, specifically including any ground for divorce under the provisions of subdivisions (1), (3) or (6) of &#167; 20-91 or &#167; 20-95;</p><p> 6. How and when specific items of such marital property were acquired;</p><p> 7. The debts and liabilities of each spouse, the basis for such debts and liabilities, and the property which may serve as security for such debts and liabilities;</p><p> 8. The liquid or nonliquid character of all marital property;</p><p> 9. The tax consequences to each party;</p><p> 10. The use or expenditure of marital property by either of the parties for a nonmarital separate purpose or the dissipation of such funds, when such was done in anticipation of divorce or separation or after the last separation of the parties; and</p><p> 11. Such other factors as the court deems necessary or appropriate to consider in order to arrive at a fair and equitable monetary award.&#8221;</p><p /><p>\tThere is nothing in Virginia Code &#167; 20-107.3 permitting the court to consider the factors above in determining whether a debt is marital or separate and the plain language of subsection (E) makes clear that it has nothing to do with determining whether a debt as either marital or separate.&#160; Rather, that section is brought to bear only&#160;<em>after&#160;</em>a debt has been determined to be marital.&#160; Indeed, the appellate caselaw supports this: &#160;&quot;The court first must classify the property as either [separate, marital, or part separate and part marital property]. &#160;The court then must assign a value to the property based upon evidence presented by both parties. &#160;Finally, the court distributes try property to the parties, taking into consideration the factors presented in Code &#167; 20-107.3(E).&quot;&#160;&#160;<em>Alphin v. Alphin</em>, 15 Va. &#160;App. 395, 424 S.E.2d 572 (1992).&#160; Besides, it certainly makes sense for the court to make decisions about how to apportion a marital debt by taking into consideration the length of the marriage, the health of&#160; the&#160; parties,&#160; the&#160; actual&#160; grounds&#160; for&#160; divorce, the reasons for the dissolution of the marriage, the disparity in education between the parties,&#160; the&#160; original purpose of the debt,&#160; the lifetime benefits to be&#160; received from that debt, and the present and future earning potential&#160; of the parties.&#160; It makes little sense for the court to take that evidence into consideration when determining whether a debt is marital or separate. &#160;So why did the court do so when there is no statute or case law telling it do so or even giving it the authority to do so?</p><p /><p /><p><b><i>- Nicholas Jon Solan is a founding partner of Solan Alzamora, PLLC in Fairfax, Virginia. &#160;He specializes in family law matters throughout Northern Virginia, including divorce, custody, support and equitable distribution matters. &#160;He can be reached at (703) 359-0088 or nsolan@SAlawfirm.com. &#160;</i></b><b><i>This blog post can also be found at:&#160;</i></b><a href="http://www.salawfirm.com/blog/1105/">www.salawfirm.com/blog/1105/</a>.</p><p><b><i></i></b></p><p>\r\n</p><!--more-->Why did a trial court take into consideration the factors under Va.

aS'<p>Iowa case law is clear that if a person is behind the wheel of an automobile with the engine operating, and that person is intoxicated, they would be guilty of OWI. The vehicle does not have to be in motion, and the State does not have to prove any intent to drive. Mere &#8220;operation&#8221; of the engine is enough to satisfy the requirements for the statute.</p><p>As I have stated elsewhere on this <a href="www.thompsonjustice.com">website</a>, if you are intoxicated, and need to &#8220;sleep it off&#8221; in a car, do not place the keys in the ignition, do not sit behind the wheel, and never start the engine.</p><p>But, let&#8217;s suppose a person is sleeping behind the wheel with the engine operating, in a legal parking space. What rights to the police have to knock on the window, open the door, or otherwise begin an OWI investigation? </p><p>This question can become very complex, and it will take us to the roots of search and seizure law. Foremost, the State needs a warrant before any search or seizure is conducted, unless there is an &#8220;exception.&#8221; And in some cases, the exceptions are starting to swallow the rule.</p><p>I will skip the element of &#8220;seizure&#8221; for this discussion, and we can assume that a seizure has taken place in this case. Whether or not a legal seizure has occurred is a deep question, one that could fill many pages of blog entries.</p><p>One exception to the warrant requirement is if the State has a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. What would this be? If an officer comes across a person sleeping behind the wheel of an operating vehicle, and there are beer cans strewn about the compartment and the area around the car, this would likely be sufficient evidence for the officer to begin an OWI investigation.</p><p>Another exception to the warrant requirement is called the community caretaking exception (as discussed in State v. Crawford, 659 N.W.2d 537, 543 (Iowa 2003)). For the community caretaking exception to apply, a three-step analysis must be preformed. First, there must be a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Second, there must be evidence of a police officer engaging in a bona fide community caretaking activity. Third, the public need and interest must outweigh the intrusion upon the privacy of the citizen. </p><p>The most relevant community caretaking activities are when officers intend to act as public servants or intend offer emergency aid. Crawford, 659 N.W.2d at 543. An example of the public servant function would be when an officer stops to assist a stranded motorist with a flat tire. For the emergency aid function to apply, the officer must have an immediate, reasonable belief that a serious, dangerous event is occurring. In Crawford, the Court cites the example of &#8220;an officer providing first aid to a person slumped over the steering wheel with a bleeding gash on his head.</p><p>Where does that put us? Provided that no incriminating evidence was visible, and it was clear to the officer that the operator was merely sleeping, the case law seems to state that the officer cannot bother the person behind the wheel. </p><p>But this is a case where practice can differ slightly from the case law.</p><p>In a recent <a href="www.thompsonjustice.com">Iowa City OWI case</a>, a person was discovered sleeping in his car with the engine running. An officer parked his car behind the person&#8217;s car, then approached the driver&#8217;s window. The officer knocked and shouted for about 15-20 seconds (according to his testimony). At this point, he opened the door to the vehicle. The officer admitted there was no evidence of criminal activity, and the driver did not appear to be in distress. As he was knocking, however, he began to wonder if the driver was okay. Furthermore, the car was parked in a hospital parking ramp.</p><p>The Judge determined that the community caretaking exception applied. Much weight was placed on the fact that this took place in a hospital ramp.

aS'In New Jersey, underage drinking and driving is handled very seriously with harsh penalties. The penalties for an underage DWI charge vary in severity depending on the driver&#8217;s Blood Alcohol Level (BAC). Even a first-time offender with no criminal history can face jail time and license suspension for driving under the influence or possessing alcohol in a motor vehicle.\r\n\r\nA driver under the age of 21 with a BAC of .01-.079% may be charged for an Under 21 DWI. This offense carries a license suspension of 30-90 days and 15-30 days of community service. Offenders are required to attend an Intoxicated Driver Resource Center (IDRC) session while being detained. In this session, detainees are screened for treatment needs and educated about topics related to drinking and driving. As long as the driver&#8217;s BAC was below .08%, the charge will be heard in juvenile court. Another alcohol-related offense is an Under 21 Possession of Alcohol in a Motor Vehicle, which levies a 6 month license suspension and $500 fine to any underage person possessing or consuming alcohol in a car.\r\n\r\nIf the underage driver has a BAC exceeding .08% and below .99%, the case will no longer be held in juvenile court and they may be charged for a DWI as an adult. The DWI penalties for a BAC over .08% include a jail sentence up to 30 days, license suspension of 3 months, $3500 or more in surcharges, and $250-400 in fines. This offense also requires a 12-48 hour IDRC detainment. More severe penalties are assessed for drivers with a BAC greater than .10% including an increased license suspension of 7-12 months and fines of $300-500 in addition to the penalties for a general DWI.\r\n\r\nAn underage drunk driving charge is not an open-and-shut case because there are many possible defenses that can challenge the charge. For one, the low standard of .01% BAC can be triggered by substances other than alcohol such as hand sanitizer or mouthwash. Other possible defenses include the police officer having probable cause for the vehicle stop and the officer following proper protocol. An experienced New Jersey DWI attorney can determine which defense is applicable to your case.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey DWI Lawyer Michele Finizio Defends Underage Drunk Drivers to the Fullest Extent of the Law\r\n\r\nYoung adults facing DWI charges or similar alcohol offenses are in a delicate and pivotal point in their lives. Due to the high stakes of an underage drunk driving charge, it is important to consult an experienced New Jersey DWI lawyer.

aS'<p>\r\n\r\nAttorney David Allen examines a case in which same-sex couples sued the State of Arizona when the State Legislature did away with health care benefits for same-sex partners of state employees. Arizona voters earlier passed a constitutional amendment which defined marriage as a relationship existing only between a man and woman. The same-sex employees of the State contended the state legislature discriminated against them and they were denied equal protection under the United States Constitution. The State argued discrimination never took place because the same-sex couples were never recognized as being part of a &quot;marital&quot; relationship.

Even medical schools sometimes don\'t get it right. In 2007, the prestigious Karolinska Institutet in Sweden matriculated an applicant convicted of murder, which raised tough ethical issues. Though the vast majority of applicants need not worry about such serious crimes, it\'s important to address any criminal record in the admissions process.</p><p line-height: 1.59375; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;" dir="ltr">[See <a  rel="nofollow" text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/medical-school-admissions-doctor/2011/07/18/3-reasons-to-include-a-medical-school-application-addendum">three reasons to include an M.D. application addendum</a>.]</p><p line-height: 1.59375; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;" dir="ltr">Most medical schools ask applicants to disclose prior convictions.

aS"<p>\r\n\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; So I finally got a diagnosis about my left leg pain.&#160; Two in fact.&#160; Later in the day after Christmas, I got a voicemail message from my primary care physician that the radiologist had read my lumbar MRI and that it looked pretty good.&#160; There was a little spot around L3-4 which might cause some minor discomfort, but that I should keep on pushing prednisone and would be better soon.&#160; He was sure of this since I had been making such good progress over the past week, during which my condition continued to deteriorate.&#160; Then I got a call from my neurosurgeon, who had shoved the MRI disk into his home PC and also discovered that my spine looked great.&#160; No stenosis, no degenerative disease, only a herniated disk at L3-4.&#160; He asked me my symptoms, which I repeated, and he said they were perfect for that lesion, which made me feel just great.&#160; I asked him if this was a subtle finding, to which he responded that a child of four could see it, making me wonder about the age of the radiologist.</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Next question:&#160; What do I do about it?&#160; He responded that the area of injury could cause exquisite pain and was unlikely to resolve with conservative treatment, especially several weeks downstream with no improvement.&#160; If it did resolve, the lumbar defect would persist, and with my active (psychotic) lifestyle, I could expect it to erupt again at the slightest irritation from running or other exercise, bringing back the rat that keeps on gnawing. &#160;He recommended a microdiskectomy, and soon, which made me feel even better.&#160; The procedure was described as &quot;minimally invasive surgery,&quot; which can be loosely translated as , &quot;It still hurts like hell.&quot; He was off for the week, but offered to draft a partner to perform the surgery in a couple of days, which I declined.&#160; He then offered to have his office set up an evaluation and pre-op so that I could be&#160;his first case for the following week on January 2, 2013.&#160; What a way to ring in the new year.&#160; I jumped at the offer, and the following day limped into my office on crutches to begin arranging my schedule so that I could have the procedure without losing my practice in the meantime. I already had jury trials booked for January 7 and 28 in state and federal court, respectively, and the doctor made it clear there was no way I could cover the first one.&#160; He said to plan on 3-4 weeks for recovery.</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; By Friday, December 28, I was enjoying the day filling out forms everywhere I went in the bowels of North Carolina Baptist Hospital.&#160; There is even a form (I swear I am not making this up) one has to sign at each clinic stating that you consent to being seen at this visit.&#160; So how many patients show up at the front desk just to tell the receptionist that they object to being seen and have appeared only to give formal notice, before departing in disgust?&#160; I was briefed and&#160;debriefed about my prior medical history, going back to childhood, whether I thought I was pregnant or had AIDs, did I want my wife to receive any medical information about my condition, was I happy about what happened to me, etc.&#160; I was asked 50 times for my name and date of birth, which must be some type of minimal IQ test.&#160; They even demanded to look at my driver's license to confirm that&#160;I was not some phantom patient out on another&#160;Munchausen's binge over the holidays.&#160; Then the poking and prodding began, with bloodwork, manipulation of limbs and the piece de resistance----everyone wanted to see how well I could walk (they were disappointed).</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; But the best part was the informed consent.&#160; You can die, go blind, or be paralyzed just from the operation itself.&#160; Then there are the potential peripheral neuropathies from positioning, capped by possible injuries to blood vessels, nerves and other adjacent structures, such as the spinal cord.&#160; Anesthesia alone can be catastrohpic, before the surgeon even gets up to bat.&#160; So if a mallet nicks my aorta, or a rongeur collapses a kidney, it's all&#160;part of that global risk one assumes every time the patient goes under the knife.&#160; The chance may be only one in 10,000, but if it happens to you. . . .&#160;</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Then it was time for pre-op instructions, with a 100-page booklet telling me what not&#160;to do the night before surgery, when, where&#160;and how to arrive and what to expect.&#160; I am limited to clear liquids&#160;the night before, so I am trying to figure out a way to dilute egg nog to fit my presurgical needs.&#160; I am told to expect an hour of surgery per disk, so with a 7:00 a.m. start time,&#160;I plan to be doing the teaberry shuffle&#160;by noon.&#160; I will even let my wife watch this miracle, assuming the consent forms I signed permit her to do so.&#160; Everyone talks about giving someone else a new fundamental orifice when angered, but I expect to have a new dorsal porthole soon, courtesy of&#160;neurosurgical science.&#160; I have always wanted to know what is going on behind my back, and modern medicine has now devised a way to open up that brave new world&#160;of rear view perspective.&#160; God, it's great to be alive.</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; What I really miss is walking, something I have been doing since I was 18 months old.&#160; It never occurred to me, watching all those gomers tool around in their hoverounds at the shopping mall and the airport, what the loss of perambulation involves.&#160; My former peripatetic ways have become quite para-pathetic.&#160; I observe the post-Xmas crowd milling around, upright and oblivious, taking for granted the gift of functioning limbs just like I did for six decades.&#160; Grabbing a glass of orange juice in the morning, or brewing up a cup of Irish tea, has become an ordeal of crutches and clutches as each part of my&#160;body strains to mimic what was once an unconscious protocol.&#160; I refuse to talk about bath time.&#160;We forget the trials of those less fortunate who struggle with physical handicaps for a lifetime, a suffering no amount of money or comfort can assuage.&#160; The next time I take a pain-free step, I plan to relish the experience of mobility. But I also hope that, the next time I spy someone crippled by whatever malady has taken&#160;away&#160;his precious walk, I will also remember what it was like when that luxury was, albeit briefly,&#160;stripped from me.&#160; I will in addition try to be more charitable to those who suffer chronic pain for reasons of pathology over which they have no control, and even&#160;to those who do. These are my new year's resolutions.</p><p />"

aS'<p>In our daily commute we always encounter foolish drivers- we rant and rave when someone cuts us off forcing us to slam on our brakes or when someone is so distracted that they cannot seem to stay within their own lane. But our reaction is simply to yell in our cars commenting on how the driver acts drunk- make some gestures to let the driver know of our displeasure and continue on our way. I was recently thinking about this phenomenon and wondered how many times we ignore fanatic drivers- excusing them as distracted when they are actually driving while intoxicated. And if we excuse all drunk drivers as bad drivers how many lives are we putting in jeopardy? Here is a list of 11 ways to spot a drunk driver and what action we should take to get them off the streets.</p><p><br />Blatant signs of intoxication:</p><p><b>1. Floating through the lane</b><br />\tDrunk drivers will swerve as they are unable to focus and have a sever impairment on their judgment of distances. This can also lead to over-correcting and cause collisions with objects near the road or other vehicles.<br /><b>2. Veering off course</b><br />\tAn obvious clue that a driver is either intoxicated or falling asleep is if they are driving on the incorrect side of the road, or on the shoulder.<br /><b>3. Hitting or nearly colliding with objects near the road</b><br />\tDue to blurred vision, fatigue and delayed reaction time, drunk drivers sometimes collide with mail boxes, telephone poles or parked cars.<br /><b>4. Center Line Hugging</b><br />\tIntoxicated drivers will hug the lane divider in an attempt to avoid swerving and veering off the road.</p><p><br />Less-Obvious signs of an intoxicated driver:</p><p><br /><b>5. Making Wide Turns</b><br />\tOver-doing basic maneuvers is common with drunk drivers because of the difficulty they have judging distances.<br /><b>6. Driving Under the Speed Limit</b><br />\tDriving more than 10mph under the speed limit can indicate a drunk driver trying to be extra cautious to avoid detection. If a driver is moving that slowly be cautious and look for other signs of intoxication.<br /><b>7. Tailgating</b><br />\tTailgating can simply be attributed to an annoying and dangerous habit, but it can also be a drunk driver attempting to drive straight by imitating the vehicle in front of them. Tailgating is always unsafe, but even more so when an intoxicated person with slow reaction time is involved.<br /><b>8. Excessive Breaking</b><br />\tWith limited ability to focus and react an intoxicated driver may break erratically and unnecessarily in an attempt to avoid a collision and a DUI.<br /><b>9. Not Using Headlights</b><br />\tA driver not using their headlights may be a drunk driver not functioning well enough to even use their vehicle properly.<br /><b>10. Inappropriate signaling</b><br />\tA drunk driver may use their left hand signal when making a right hand turn.<br /><b>11. Stopping For No Reason</b><br />\tStopping at a green light, an intersection without a stop sign or an empty crosswalk can show that a driver is not sober.</p><p><br />I am sure you have encountered the signs above as well as I have and ignored them- attributing them to a bad driver and simply drove around them. When you witness these signs you should watch for other signs of inebriation- stay behind them at a safe distance and contact the police so they may get the driver off the roads. If we all do our part to catch drunk drivers our roads will be that much safer.</p><!--more-->11 tips on how to spot drunk drivers and avoid them on the road!'

aS'The ex-wife of singer Marc Anthony has filed for $100,000 more per \r\nmonth in child support. This stunning amount is based on Dayanara \r\nTorres\'s <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://thestir.cafemom.com/love&#95;sex/164736/marc&#95;anthonys&#95;ex&#95;wants&#95;100k">claim</a>\r\n that singer Marc Anthony is not paying enough in child support for her \r\ntwo boys, ages 10 and 12.&#160; Torres currently receives $13,000 per month \r\nin child support as well as $3,500 in spousal support.\r\n<p>Torres claims that not only does Anthony make millions every year, \r\nentitling her and her sons to a larger share of his earnings, but that \r\nhis other ex-wife, the famous Jennifer Lopez or J-Lo, receives more than\r\n she does. Lopez was married to Anthony for eight years compared to \r\nTorres\'s four.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Truth about Child Support Amounts</strong></p>\r\n<p>In most cases, judges try to base child support on a percentage of \r\nthe non-custodial parent\'s income.&#160; This system is designed to keep \r\nthings fair for everyone, but it can become problematic when one \r\nparent\'s income is far in excess of the other&#8217;s.&#160; In the case of Marc \r\nAnthony, his income is so large that the judge who initially set the \r\nchild and spousal support amounts must have simply come up with a figure\r\n that seemed fair to support the children in the lifestyle to which they\r\n were accustomed.&#160; The child support amount given to each child may also\r\n have been considered maintenance, while Anthony may have been expected \r\nto gift each child with money in addition to these payments.</p>\r\n<p>Whatever the reason, Torres now claims that it is not enough.&#160; She is\r\n making this claim based on what the boys\' lifestyle should be rather \r\nthan what it currently is, and also based on the fact that Lopez\'s \r\nchildren allegedly receive more money than hers.</p>\r\n<p>Child support amounts are largely at the discretion of the presiding \r\njudge, although many states also have minimum and maximum percentages or\r\n formulas used to calculate support.&#160; However, a judge does have control\r\n over the amount in other ways.&#160; For example, splitting physical custody\r\n unevenly could result in one parent having the child more often than \r\nthe other and could lead to a larger amount of child support paid.&#160; Some\r\n parents also agree to pay more than the statutory amount to help \r\nsupport their children.</p>\r\n<p>If you are facing a <a  rel="nofollow" target="&#95;self" href="http://www.menslegal.com/" title="Men\'s Legal Center">child support battle</a>, it is important to have strong legal representation from a <a  rel="nofollow" target="&#95;self" href="http://www.menslegal.com/san-diego-divorce-attorneys-contact-us.html" title="Contact the Men\'s Legal Center">family law attorney</a>.</p>'

The Alameda County Superior Court lawsuit claims the largest privately owned U.S. fitness chain has systematically discriminated against minority and female workers regarding promotions to management jobs and equal pay, violating the California Fair Employment and Housing Act and the California Business and Profession Code. The suit demands that 24 Hour Fitness end its alleged discriminatory practices and provide back pay and damages to the employees who say they were treated unfairly.</p><p>The company issued a statement saying it\'s &quot;deeply committed to providing a work environment that is free from unlawful discrimination and retaliation. &quot;24 Hour Fitness makes its hiring and promotional decisions without regard to race, national origin, gender or any other protected basis,&quot; it said. &quot;We firmly deny the allegations made in the complaint and we expect to prevail when all the facts are heard.&quot; The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund and the Oakland law firm of Lewis, Feinberg, Lee, Renaker &amp; Jackson represent the plaintiffs. &quot;I am a competitor and I strive to be my best, but at 24 Hour Fitness that is not recognized,&quot; lead plaintiff Raoul Fulcher, who says he was passed over for promotions because he\'s African-American, said in a Legal Defense and Education Fund news release. </p><p>Bill Lann Lee, an attorney for the plaintiffs who was the nation\'s top civil rights prosecutor as an assistant attorney general during the Clinton administration, said the company &quot;promises customers a family fitness environment&quot; but &quot;does not treat its minority and women employees as part of the family.

aS'While not everyone who divorces becomes depressed, a new study \r\nasserts that for certain people, divorce can increase the risk of future\r\n episodes of depression.\r\n<p>The study was published in the <i>Clinical Psychological Science </i>journal\r\n and noted the association between receiving a divorce decree and having\r\n future bouts of depression. Researchers determined that a divorce can \r\nincrease the risk of future depression for those who have already been \r\ndiagnosed with the condition. However, for those who do not suffer from \r\ndepression prior to the divorce, there was no link between obtaining the\r\n divorce and future depressive episodes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Stress Scale</strong></p>\r\n<p>Divorce is one of the most stressful life events anyone can undergo. \r\nOn most scales that rate stressors, divorce is at the very top of the \r\nlist along with death of a loved one and, ironically, divorce is the \r\ndeath of a marriage.</p>\r\n<p>Investigators posed a question: Since certain factors such as marital\r\n discord, neuroticism and hostility are more likely to lead to divorce, \r\ndo these factors also increase the risk for depression?</p>\r\n<p>Researchers matched participants who had separated or divorced during\r\n the study to someone with the same number of previously identified \r\nfactors who had not divorced. The researchers were able to account for \r\nthe random assignment of people to various test groups in this manner, \r\nsince it is impossible to randomly assign those who will divorce or stay\r\n married.</p>\r\n<p>While researchers immediately found that there was a link between \r\ndivorce and depression, there was a much more complex dynamic at play. \r\nDivorce and separation only increased the likelihood of depression for \r\nthose who had already had depressive episodes in the past. Nearly 60 \r\npercent of those with a history of depression who divorced during the \r\nstudy experienced a depressive episode after their divorce was final.</p>\r\n<p>Those with no history of depression had no elevated risk for future \r\nepisodes. About 10 percent of the people who divorced experienced \r\ndepression after the break-up. Researchers are unsure if those with no \r\nhistory of depression simply have better coping skills or if something \r\nabout the breakup exacerbates an underlying depression tendency.</p>\r\n<p>Those who are facing divorce have enough stress in their lives already.

aS'<p>Many jurisdictions within New York State permit drivers charged with speeding tickets to plead those tickets down to less serious charges, including parking violations. The practice of allowing speeding tickets to be reduced to the non-moving violation of a parking offense has been troubling to New York State lawmakers because aside from the perceived safety issue raised by this practice, the reduction to a parking violation avoids the mandatory state surcharges imposed on moving violations and allows the revenue collected from the parking violation offense to be retained by the locality.&#160; <p /></p><p>In an effort to stem the loss of revenue to the State, the Legislature included a measure in the State budget passed April 1, 2013 which will impose a $25.00 surcharge on speeding tickets that are pleaded down to a parking offense. This will make the overall cost somewhat greater for the fine payable for bargained-for parking violation. However, despite the increased costs, this outcome remains a far better disposition than a guilty plea to a speeding violation because it avoids points on a driver&#8217;s license, increased insurance premiums and possible NYSDMV assessments.<p /></p><p>Motorists charged with speeding tickets and other traffic offenses in a Suffolk County court can contact our office and receive a free consultation.

aS'<p><strong></strong><br />Every business depends on contractual relationships with its suppliers, customers, employees, and others. Large corporations have legal departments to draft and review contracts. Most small businesses enter into contracts without prior legal review, so here are some common mistakes to avoid when creating a business contract.</p><em><strong>Relying on an oral contract</strong></em><p>Mark Twain once said, &#8220;Oral contracts aren&#8217;t worth the paper they&#8217;re written on.&#8221; It is not the case that oral contracts are valueless, as oral contracts are enforceable under Texas law. If both parties to an oral contract perform as promised, that oral contract is perfectly fine. The problems with oral contracts arise when there is a dispute about performance. </p><p>When a party to an oral contract wants to have a judge enforce the terms of that oral contract, it is that party&#8217;s burden to prove to the judge, by a preponderance of the evidence, exactly what the terms of the agreement were. That is often challenging, if not impossible. So it is best that business contracts be in writing.</p><em><strong>Relying on terms discussed during negotiations, but not included in the signed contract</strong></em><p>Once you memorialize the terms of an agreement in a signed written contract, only the written contract terms are enforceable. It does not matter what other terms were discussed during negotiations, even if the parties came to an agreement. </p><p>When a dispute arises and the matter goes to trial, when a written contract exists intended to completely embody the terms of the parties&#8217; agreement, a party is not allowed to present conflicting terms &#8211; no matter how minor &#8211; discussed prior to or at the time of the signing the contract. The legal term for this is the <i>parole evidence rule</i>, which prohibits giving testimony about any expression&#8212;oral or written&#8212;made prior to the written contract as well as any oral expressions made at the time of signing the contract. </p><p>So, for example, if at the time of signing a contract the parties acknowledge that some terms are missing or incorrect, it is not sufficient just to agree to additions or modifications with a handshake. Take the time to write an addendum and sign it along with the contract.</p><em><strong>Lack of specificity</strong></em><p>To avoid future disputes and to properly protect the business interests of the parties, the provisions of a contract should be clearly defined. This is particularly true when non-standard performance is intended. When a judge views a contract missing essential terms, the judge imposes reasonable terms. So, for example, if you intended that your supplier ship products to you with expedited delivery, your contract must state that. Otherwise, a judge would rule that standard delivery constitutes adequate performance by your supplier.</p><em><strong>Failing to take the time required to get the written contract written correctly</strong></em><p>Negotiating business agreements can be complicated and time consuming. Thus, it is not surprising that when negotiations conclude and a deal agreed upon, the parties want to get to work right away and rush to sign a contract. But rushing to write and sign a contract can lead to errors and/or omissions that result in costly litigation down the road.</p><em><strong>Failing to read a proposed contract carefully</strong></em><p>Whether you draft a contract yourself or are presented with a proposed contract drafted by the other party, it is important to read every word carefully. Of course, it is important to verify that the contract clearly reflects the intentions of the parties. But even clerical errors, such as a punctuation mistake or the use of the word <i>and</i> where an <i>or</i> should be, can alter the meaning of an essential term of the contract.</p><em><strong>Not seeking legal advice</strong></em><p>Business contracts can be risky when legal issues are unknown or overlooked. Contract law is made up of Texas statutes enacted by the legislature and case law developed by the judicial system. Only experienced <a href="http://www.attorneysforbusiness.com/">Dallas business lawyers</a> can give you the legal advice your business needs when entering into contracts or when disputes arise later.

aS'<p>When traveling through the busy highways and roads of California, a driver in Glendale, El Segundo, and Venice Beach can get accustomed to seeing car accidents on the side of the road.  Most of the time, we don&#8217;t think too much of the accidents or their victims; however, this changes when we become the victim of a car accident.  Back injuries are common and painful consequences of car accidents.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>All back injuries should be taken seriously, but many car accident victims do not realize how serious their injuries are immediately as symptoms often take hours or even days to fully develop.  Collision victims often refuse medical evaluation at the site of the accident believing that their soreness is just from stress or inconsequential.  By the next day, inflammation has been allowed to continue and muscles will spasm and seize.  By that time, an opportunity has been missed for the victim to begin evaluation and treatment early, reducing damage.  </p><p>The <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/pages/100221/car-accident-victims.htm">victim of a car crash</a> should take any soreness seriously, seeking evaluation in a clinic or hospital immediately.   Depending upon the first responders to be able to accurately assess the victim&#8217;s condition can be a painful mistake.\r\n\r\nWhen symptoms do begin to appear, they are often very painful and will worsen without treatment.  Upper back injuries are very common as the neck will be whipped back and forth during a collision, straining the muscles of the upper and mid back.  </p><p>Lower back injuries are also common as the body may be twisted violently.  These movements are out of the normal range of motion for the back and often result in strains, sprains, tears, as well as disc injuries and injuries to the delicate nerves contained within the spine.  Inflammation and nerve impingement can result in loss of sensation of the extremities such as the hands and feet, as well as loss of function of remote parts of the body such as the bowels and bladder. \r\n\r\n</p><p>Of course, the most noticeable side-effect of back injuries is the inability to move properly and function as one normally would.  This can have devastating and long-term effects on the personal and work life of a victim if untreated.  If you or your loved one is the victim of back injuries due to a car accident caused by another&#8217;s negligence, a personal injury attorney can help you get the medical treatment and recompense you deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/pages/3140/Auto-Accident-Lawyer-LA.htm">Back injuries car accident</a> <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/">personal injury lawyer</a> at Ehline Law Firm PC waiting for your call at 655 North Central Avenue 17th Floor Glendale, CA 91203 USA +818.485.2311.</p><!--more-->Collision victims often refuse medical evaluation at the site of the \r\naccident believing that their soreness is just from stress or \r\ninconsequential.

aS"<b><p>I. HOW to do it</p><p>Situation #1: When your Divorce is Still Pending: </p></b><p>If you are currently getting a divorce, you will be able to get a copy of your divorce decree after the judge signs it. It will be available from the Clerk in the county where your Texas divorce is filed. (usually the <u>district</u> clerk, rather than the county clerk) If you have an attorney, and your case is still open, your attorney will usually either get a decree for you or give you instructions on how to get the decree on your own. <br /><br />In some courts, the decree will be available as soon as you are finished with the final hearing and you will be able to walk to the district clerk's office and get a stamped decree. In other counties/courts, you will be asked to wait for a number of days until the file is processed, sent to the clerk, and imaged. </p><p>There is a copy fee (see below).</p><b><p>Situation #2: Your Divorce is Final, and Your Case is Already Closed</p></b><p>Your case may be complete, and may have even been completed several years ago. You should call or visit the district clerk in the county where your divorce was rendered. The more information that you have the better and will help the clerk locate your case more efficiently. The case number is the best piece of information to have before contacting the clerk. You will also be asked the names of the parties, and perhaps the approximate year or which court was presiding. </p><p>Unless your case has been recently completed, it is generally better to contact the district clerk directly yourself, rather than contacting the attorney who represented you in your divorce. Doing so will save you time since an old file is likely to be archived, in storage or even destroyed.(most firms do not keep family law files forever). Secondly, if you are going to get a copy of a court document, you should take the time to get a certified copy, and only the clerk's office can do that for you. Thirdly, you will want to be sure that you have the absolutely final version that was signed by the judge - an unsigned copy from an old file may not be the final version. </p><b><p>Information about cost: </p></b><p>You may be asked if you want a regular or certified copy of the decree. Get the certified. It is usually the same price as the regular (generally, about $1.00 per page). For all &quot;official&quot; situations, you will need a certified decree. (A certified decree bears an official stamp or seal).</p><p>Personal checks are usually not accepted. </p><b><p>II. WHY would you want to? </p></b><p>There are many reasons why you may need a copy of a divorce decree, here are just a few!</p><p>-to begin or end child support withholding</p><p>- to change a name on a driver's license, social security card, passport, insurance policy, or piece of property</p><p>- to review and follow a visitation schedule</p><p>-for transfer of property, deed or refinance</p><p>-to review provisions regarding responsibility for debt</p><p>-for income tax purposes</p><p>-for probate reasons, after one of the parties has died</p><p>-for family research reasons</p><p>-to apply for a state license in a profession, apply for a passport or other official document</p><p>-for your own good record keeping<b></b> </p><p>You should keep&#160;a certified copy of your divorce decree with your important papers.</p><p><strong>Kalish Law Office, Family Attorneys since 1984; The Woodlands, Conroe, Spring, Houston</strong></p><!--more-->It's hard to stay organized and harder still to get your hands on an important document at the time when you need it.

aS'<p><strong>THE 500 FOOT RULE</strong> </p><p>Ordinarily, an application for an on-premises liquor license must be approved unless the Authority finds there is good cause not to issue the license. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, however, contains restrictions on the approval of certain on-premises liquor licenses if the location is within a 500 foot radius of certain other establishments with on-premises liquor licenses. The restrictions apply only in cities, towns or villages with a population of 20,000 or more. The restrictions are commonly referred to as the &quot;<a href="http://www.abc.state.ny.us/500-foot-rule-announcement-march-6-2009">500 foot rule&quot;.</a> </p><p><strong>ESTABLISHMENTS SUBJECT TO THE 500 FOOT RULE</strong> </p><p>Applications for licenses under Section 64, 64-a, 64-c and 64-d of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law are all, to some degree, subject to the 500 foot rule. These statutes provide for &quot;full&quot; (liquor, wine and beer) liquor licenses for the on-premises license. </p><p>A license under Section 64 can only be issued to a restaurant, hotel with a restaurant, catering establishment, club, vessel or aircraft. Establishments obtaining a license under this section must have a kitchen, with a chef, serving meals. </p><p>Section 64-a provides for the &quot;special&quot; on-premises license. The statute allows certain establishments to obtain an on-premises license without meeting the restaurant/kitchen requirement of Section 64. These establishments fall into two categories: 1) nightclubs, bars, taverns, etc, that do not have kitchen facilities and primarily serve alcoholic beverages rather than food; and 2) theaters and other entertainment facilities. Establishments obtaining a license under Section 64-a are not required to have kitchen facilities, but must regularly keep food (sandwiches, soups, etc.) available for sale to customers. </p><p>Section 64-c provides for the &quot;restaurant-brewer&quot; license. In addition to allowing the licensee to brew a limited amount of beer on the premises, the licensee must operate a restaurant at the establishment. </p><p>Pursuant to Section 64-d a &quot;cabaret&quot; license is required for any on-premises establishment that: (1) permits musical entertainment, singing, dancing or other forms of entertainment; and (2) has a capacity of 600 or more persons. This section primarily addresses large nightclubs. It should not be confused with the cabaret permit issued by the City of New York, which is required for certain establishments regardless of whether alcoholic beverages are served. </p><p><strong>EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE </strong></p><p><strong>PUBLIC INTEREST</strong> </p><p>If the location is subject to the 500 foot rule, and no other exception applies, the license cannot be issued unless the State Liquor Authority makes an affirmative finding that it is in the public interest to issue the license. This clearly creates a presumption that the license should not be issued. There is, however, no &quot;public interest&quot; exception for applications for a cabaret license. </p><p>The 500 foot rule requires that the Authority consult with the municipality or community board and conduct a hearing to gather facts to determine whether the public interest would be served by issuing the license. This is commonly referred to as the &quot;500 foot hearing&quot;. When considering whether it would be in the public interest to approve the application, the Authority may consider the following: </p><p>?&#160;the number, classes and character of other licensed premises not only in the area where the proposed establishment will be located but also in the particular municipality (or subdivision of the municipality); <br />&#160; <br />?&#160;whether the applicant has obtained all other necessary governmental licenses and permits; <br />&#160; <br />?&#160;the effect on vehicular traffic and parking in proximity to the location; <br />&#160; <br />?&#160;the impact on the existing noise level; <br />&#160; <br />?&#160;the history of ABC violations and reported criminal activity at the location; and <br />&#160; <br />?&#160;any other factor specified by law or regulation that would be relevant to deciding whether public convenience and advantage, as well as the public interest, would be served by approving the application.</p><p>The hearing required by the 500 foot rule is conducted before designated staff in the Authority\'s four offices. The Members of the Authority have delegated to specific licensing staff the ability to approve applications when, after the hearing is conducted, there is no community opposition and no other reason for disapproval. In cases where the application is opposed by the community, the matter is referred to the Members of the Authority for determination. However, the fact that the community opposes an application does not mean that the Authority must disapprove the application. Conversely, an application may be disapproved even if the community supports it. </p><p>When such matters are referred to the Members of the Authority, the applicant may come to an agreement with the &quot;community opposition&quot; on stipulations concerning the operation of the establishment. In such cases, the Members of the Authority may incorporate those stipulations into the approved method of operation of the licensed premises. These stipulations essentially become conditions of the license privilege. Failure to comply with those conditions subjects the licensee to disciplinary action. </p><p><strong>&quot;GRANDFATHER&quot; CLAUSE</strong> </p><p>The 500 foot rule specifically excludes any licensed establishment that was licensed when the rule went into effect on November 1, 1993. If an application is received for an establishment at a location that has been continuously licensed since that date, it is not subject to the rule. &quot;Continuously&quot; means without interruption. If the location was not licensed for any period of time, it has not been continuously licensed. To obtain the protection of this exemption, it does not matter what kind of license was issued for the location, or whether it had been licensed to the same person or corporation. </p><p><strong>RENEWALS </strong></p><p>A renewal of a license cannot be denied because of the 500 foot rule. In addition, applications to approve corporate changes (new individuals taking over the existing licensed corporation) are not subject to the 500 foot rule since the corporation continues to hold the license. If you need assistance with a renewal or any litigation matter involving liquor licensing laws contact an <a href="http://www.stacyweisslaw.com/" target="&#95;blank">alcoholic beverage commission attorney.</a></p>'

Every single day, millions of people and cargo are transported around the world via air transport. Unfortunately, travelling by air could also be risky, as it is an act that combines high altitudes, high speed and extremely volatile chemicals. Hence, any simple mistakes or errors can lead to catastrophic aviation accidents, leading to injuries and loss of lives.</p><p dir="ltr" /><p dir="ltr">If you or a loved one is involved in an aviation accident, a claim for damages can be recovered from those responsible for the accident, through a lawsuit. This is where a personal injury lawyer comes in. In any cases of aviation accidents, you can engage a personal injury lawyer to help you to understand your legal rights after the aviation accident and to fight for your rights to a claim.</p><p dir="ltr" /><p dir="ltr">Who may be held responsible for aviation accidents? Some parties that can be held responsible include the pilots, the airlines, the manufacturer of the plane and its key parts, the owner of the plane, and those directly or indirectly involved in causing the accident.</p><p dir="ltr" /><p dir="ltr">A personal injury lawyer will be able to offer you professional advice regarding the lawsuit to recover your damages. There are some legal rights concerning aviation accidents that many people are ignorant of. For example, the injured victim in an aviation accident may be able to bring a claim along with his or her spouse. This is because they are entitled to monetary compensation for the loss of support, benefits and other things that they, as a married couple, provide to one another. If the accidents resulted in loss of lives, the spouse and the children of the decedent are entitled to make charges for damages. If not, next in line are the decedents parents and siblings. Depending on the state and on the case, non-economic losses may be recognized as well.</p><p dir="ltr" /><p dir="ltr">Where aviation accident lawsuits are concerned, timing is also important. Engaging a personal injury lawyer is important; however pursuing monetary compensation does not require immediate attention. On the other hand, attending to accident injuries or mourning of the loss of your loved one should take precedence.</p><p dir="ltr" /><p dir="ltr">However, there is always a deadline for you to file your lawsuit. This deadline, imposed by your country, or sometimes another subdivision such as your state or province, is known as the statute of limitations. Depending on your location or situation, the deadline may be months or years from the date of the aviation accident. Since it is difficult to be determined, you will need to seek professional advice from a personal injury lawyer as soon as you have settled the issues at hand (e.g. got treatment for ant injuries, settled funeral arrangements, etc.) and proceed to begin your lawsuit before this deadline expires. This is very important, as once you missed the time limit, you will lose all the legal rights of recovering any monetary claims from those parties who are responsible for the aviation accident.</p><p>If you would like a more complete understanding of your legal rights, please don\'t hesitate to have a free, confidential initial consultation with the hard-working legal professionals at <a href="http://www.ledgerlaw.com/">LedgerLaw</a>.</p>'

Some of those nasty little compounds expire in hours, minutes or even a few short seconds. Several years after high school, I can now truly empathize with such ill fated compounds. I have discovered that the half-life of a principled libertarian superior court judge on the criminal bench is about one half hour.</p><p>After many years as a practicing criminal defense attorney, I decided to apply to become a judge on the court of appeals. Despite good credentials and numerous letters of recommendation from several respected judges and other accomplished people, I was not deemed worthy of an interview by the appellate court selection committee. It may have had something to do with the fact that I cited a need for intellectual diversity as my reason for wanting to become an appellate court judge and used the term &#8220;pro-freedom&#8221; in my application. Maybe I was doomed from the start.</p><p>My application to become a superior court judge pro tem2 was lodged with visions of presiding over selected criminal jury trials. As a judge pro tem, I expected to have the luxury of picking and choosing my limited trial assignments. I was determined neither to conceal nor to violate my principles. My application included a disclosure that I am on the legal committee for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (&#8220;NORML&#8221;) as well as the fact that I co-founded the <a href="http://www.freedomsummit.com/" target="&#95;blank">Freedom Summit</a>. In addition, my application included my sociations with the Foundation for Economic Education, the Future of Freedom Foundation and CATO.</p><p>I was pleasantly surprised4 when my application was approved and I was appointed for a one year term as a superior court judge pro tem. I was excited and eager to work hard and do justice.</p><p>After two months of waiting for a criminal trial assignment on a non-victimless case, I inquired about obtaining such an assignment. I learned that the superior court&#8217;s urgent need was for pro tem judges to cover the assortment of cases composing the pre-trial calendar. I had refused countless opportunities to cover court calendars I believed would contain predominately drug cases. On a day when the court was desperate for help, the court administration was agreeable to reassign a full time judge and arrange a criminal court calendar I believed would not contain many drug cases. I agreed but expected some non-violent drug cases would be on my calendar.</p><p>Determined to be honest and honorable, I decided to recuse myself on all drug related cases5. To avoid being accused of having secret or illegitimate motives, I drafted a detailed six page minute entry, explaining the legal reasons underlying my anticipated recusal. I believed the parties had a right to know why I refused to hear their case. After all, the government, including judges, are supposed to be agents of the people; not masters.</p><p>When my first (and last) day as a judge arrived, I learned there were seven drug cases on my calendar of thirty seven matters. I arranged for another judge to handle the seven drug cases and offered to take several non-drug cases in exchange. I planned to recuse myself from the seven drug cases and reassign them to the other judge to be heard that same day.</p><p>Shortly after I began my court calendar, a friendly law enforcement officer arrived with several routine arrest warrants to be signed. All but one of the proposed arrest warrants were for drug cases. The other was for a questionable gun case. I informed the law enforcement officer of my principled refusal to consider his warrants and sent him away. To my surprise, the officer informed me of his support before he left to seek out a more agreeable judge6.</p><p>Without my knowledge, the clerk e-mailed my recusal minute entry to her supervisor who forwarded it to the presiding criminal judge of the superior court. I soon found myself on the telephone with an angry judge who voiced his disagreement with my legal reasoning by referring to my minute entry as &#8220;bullshit.&#8221; He ordered me not to issue my minute entry on any cases until after he consulted with the presiding judge of the superior court7. He promised a quick call back.</p><p>Back in chambers, I informally explained to the prosecutor and defense attorney why I hesitated to call their drug case. While the defense attorney sat shocked, the prosecutor informed me of his unqualified support8. I eventually decided to retake the bench and recuse myself. I stated on the record that I intended to disclose my reasons for recusal in a detailed minute entry.</p><p>The cranky presiding criminal law judge soon called back and informed me he was not happy with my performance.</p><p>I was fired and told to leave immediately. Before I left, the clerk who initially e-mailed her supervisor with my minute entry privately told me of her unqualified support for my position. Two other defense attorneys also came back into chambers to voice their support. I walked out of court that day a bit disappointed but with my principles firmly intact.</p><p>While my judicial career was going up in flames, my good friend and guerilla libertarian activist, <a href="http://www.ernesthancock.com/" target="&#95;blank">Ernest Hancock</a> was driving to the courthouse to see me wearing the black robe. I called Ernie and told him my judicial career was over. Although neither of us predicted my lifespan as a judge would be long, his response was, &#8220;Already?&#8221; In what seemed like seconds later, the press was calling me for comment.</p><p>The next morning, I was news. The television, radio and print media all did stories about the judge who was fired because he refused to hear drug cases. I received about one hundred e-mails; not one negative. Many of the emails I received praised me for having integrity. I also learned that within hours of my firing, the presiding justice of the Arizona Supreme Court issued an order recinding my appointment as a judge pro tem10.</p><p>The Supreme court&#8217;s order stated in relevant part, &#8220;Having expressly declared his inability to be impartial in the application of the law and the disposition of cases before him.&#8230;&#8221; I found this language curious as I had not declared any inability to be impartial11. Moreover, the Supreme Court&#8217;s order appeared as if I had issues with all laws as there was no mention of drug cases specifically nor any connection with my reasons for recusal.</p><p>About a week later, an editorial writer from a major local newspaper showed up to interview me. He was shocked to learn that there was a much bigger principle involved than the right to smoke pot.</p><p>After my initial publicity waned, another local superior court judge pro tem drove drunk and killed a seventeen year old high school student who was riding a bike12. The professional, unbiased, fair and balanced newspaper editorial staff writers at the Arizona Republic published an editorial recklessly lumping me with the other judge under the title, &#8220;Two Bad Apples.&#8221;13 It wasn&#8217;t my proudest moment, but I concluded some people would draw the fine distinction.</p><p>Being unsatisfied merely that my unusually distinguished judicial career was over, the presiding judge of the superior court referred my conduct to the Commission on Judicial Conduct14. Among other things, I was accused of acting in a manner which fails to promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. I was asked to formally respond to the judicial complaint against me. After reviewing the incident and my response, the Commission on Judicial Conduct dismissed the presiding judge&#8217;s complaint against me.</p><p>Although my judicial career ended abruptly, my career as a scientist is off to a promising start. I may have been the first to discover that the compound P-L-J (principled libertarian judge) has a tragically short half-life when mixed with the highly toxic compound C-B (criminal bench). For now, I will continue my experiments combining the volatile and explosive compound A-L-C-D-A (aggressive libertarian criminal defense attorney) with all varieties of TS (toxic statists).</p>'

aS'<p>Many states are obviously facing tight budgets.&#160; When that happens, it is common to look at many different possibilities for saving revenue.&#160; One idea that has been trendy in the last few years is to &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization">privatize</a>&#8221; various government services.&#160; The theory is that for-profit businesses are more efficient than traditional government agencies and that the &#8220;profit motive&#8221; under which companies operate will help them deliver the same services better, faster, and cheaper.&#160; </p><p>Bringing for-profit corporations into the delivery of traditionally governmental services creates interesting legal arguments when things go wrong and people are injured.&#160; For example, are these businesses subject to the same state or federal statutes regarding when and how government actors are entitled to certain immunities?&#160; Does the state need to be sued along with the private corporation?&#160; Why did the governmental contract with the company in the first place?&#160; Who was really in control?&#160; Obviously, these types of partnerships between public and private entities can create quite a bit of extra legal work to try and untangle.</p><p>Let me share with you what I believe to be a cautionary tale about where privatization of government services went terribly wrong. Recently, a juvenile court judge in <a href="http://pa.gov/portal/server.pt/community/pa&#95;gov/2966">Pennsylvania</a> was indicted for cutting a shady deal with a private for-profit youth detention facility to send far more young people to the detention center than deserved it.&#160; The judge received <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kickback">kickbacks</a> from the company.&#160; </p><p>Private prisons and youth detention centers are paid by government entities like state and county governments to house inmates.&#160; The more inmates they house, the more money they make.&#160; So, how can an entrepreneurial private prison company acquire more inmates?&#160; Well, in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, they bribed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark&#95;Ciavarella">Judge Ciavarella</a>, who had run for office on a tough-on-crime platform, to throw the book at juvenile offenders.&#160; In 2002, then Luzerne County, PA <a href="http://www.timesleader.com/news/hottopics/judges">Judge Conahan</a> shut down the state juvenile detention center and used money from the county budget to fund a lease for the private facilities.&#160; While this raised eyebrows, it was still approved. </p><p>The scheme worked like this: <a href="http://pahomepage.com/fulltext?nxd&#95;id=96802">Robert Mericle</a>, a builder and close friend of Ciavarella, and <a href="http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/powell-pleads-guilty-1.99257">Robert Powell</a>, an attorney who co-owned two youth detention facilities paid the judge &#8220;finder&#8217;s fees&#8221; or kickbacks for sentencing juveniles to those facilities.&#160; Both Judges Conahan and Ciavarella have <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/pa/PubArticlePA.jsp?Ciavarella&#95;and&#95;Conahan&#95;May&#95;Face&#95;Very&#95;Different&#95;Sentences&id=1202495999864&slreturn=1&hbxlogin=1">pleaded guilty</a> to various fraud and racketeering charges.&#160; They have been named as defendants in a civil lawsuit as well.&#160; Powell turned state&#8217;s witness for the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a>.</p><p>From 2003 to 2007, Luzerne County would pay Powell&#8217;s company $30 million dollars to house juveniles.&#160; It could have built its own facility for less than 1/3 of that - $9 million.&#160; The <a href="http://www.ncjjservehttp.org/NCJJWebsite/main.html">National Center for Juvenile Justice</a> lists Pennsylvania as the state with the second most private detention centers (behind Florida).</p><p>The Philadelphia-based <a href="http://www.jlc.org/">Juvenile Law Center</a> had first raised flags about Judge Ciaravella in 1999, when a 13-year-old boy was detained without being read his rights and appeared in court without a lawyer.&#160; A <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC&#95;CR&#95;0387&#95;0001&#95;ZS.html">Supreme Court decision</a> in 1967 clarified that children have a constitutional right to counsel, however, about half of the children that Judge Ciavarella sentenced did not have representation.&#160; It&#8217;s not clear from the record that Judge Ciavarella advised the youths or their parents of the potential risks of not having representation as is required. </p><p>The judge sent juveniles as young as 10 to the detention center for weeks or months for crimes as varied as setting up a MySpace page mocking a principal, trespassing in a vacant building, a simple assault resulting in a black eye, or pocketing change from unlocked vehicles&#160;&#160; A 17-year-old boy with no previous record spent six months in a detention center for possession of drug paraphernalia, but never recovered and, ultimately committed suicide.&#160; </p><p>The sentences handed down by Judge Ciaravella were out of line with recommendations by probation officers and out of line with the sentences handed down by other judges.&#160; He sent 25% of his juvenile defendants to detention centers from 2002-2006 compared with a state rate of 10%.&#160; He also routinely refused and ignored requests for leniency from prosecutors and probation officers.</p><p>This was a perfect storm of a for-profit enterprise colliding and colluding with a profiteer who was willing to walk over the constitutional rights of minors for money.&#160; &#8220;The juvenile system, by design, is intended to be a less punitive system than the adult system, and yet here were scores of children with very minor infractions having their lives ruined,&#8221; according to <a href="http://www.jlc.org/about/staff/marsha&#95;levick/">Marsha Levick</a>, a lawyer with the Juvenile Law Center.&#160; &#8220;There was a culture of intimidation surrounding this judge and no one was willing to speak up about the sentences he was handing down </p><p>Of course, not every privatized service will result in the nightmare scenario we&#8217;ve just described. This catastrophe occurred not just because of a greedy businessman, but because of a greedy government official.&#160; However, there are plenty of examples of both.&#160; </p><p>The legal process will likely take years to resolve.&#160; Both criminal charges and civil lawsuits have been filed.&#160; Those involved will spend a lot of time in jail for their crimes.&#160; The business, the governmental entities who contracted with the business, and the culpable individuals will be sued in state and federal court for everything from personal injury/tort claims, to fraud, to civil rights violations, to class actions for overcharges in fees and expenses incurred by these poor families. </p><p>Meanwhile, Judge Ciaravella now <a href="http://www.jlc.org/luzerne/">sits convicted</a> of crimes with possible maximum sentences totaling 157 years in prison (for which he might serve 15 ? years), stripped of his bench and his robe, required to pay back nearly $1 million, and a defendant in a class action suit.&#160; A judge sworn to uphold the law and serve justice instead upheld vengeance and served greed.&#160; I wonder if he ever counted the cost in anything other than dollars.</p><p /><!--more-->Of course, not every privatized service will result in the nightmare scenario we&#8217;ve just described.

aS'<p>The <a title="Ohio defense lawyers" href="http://www.ohio-criminal-lawyer.com/" target="&#95;self">Ohio defense lawyers</a> of Robey &amp; Robey review over the latest in the case of Connick vs. Thompson.&#160; </p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review Connick v. Thompson, a Louisiana case testing the limits of prosecutorial immunity from a lawsuit based upon the prosecutor\'s office alleged failure to properly train its lawyers about their obligation to disclose evidence that it helpful to the defense.</p><p>In this case, Mr. Thompson was accused of an unrelated armed robbery case,&#160;in addition to a murder charge&#160;in the 1984 death of Raymond Liuzza, Jr., in New Orleans.&#160;The prosecutors chose&#160;to hold the armed robbery trial first, in hope that a conviction in the first case would effectively preclude Thompson from testifying in his murder trial. Thompson\'s lawyers later learned that prosecutors withheld exculpatory evidence in the robbery trial, that the real perpetrator had a different blood type than Thompson. He was found guilty of the robbery and elected not to testify in his murder case. He was convicted in the murder case and sentenced to death. On appeal, Thompson\'s lawyers claimed the&#160;prosecutors\'s failure to reveal the helpful evidence violated their obligations under the law in Brady&#160;v. Maryland. This failure to turn over helpful evidence deprived Thompson of his right to testify in his murder trial. Lower courts agreed and awarded Thompson&#160;$ 14 million&#160;for&#160;his wrongful conviction. The prosecutor\'s office then appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court claiming &quot;prosecutorial immunity&quot; to such lawsuits.</p><p>&#160;The&#160;lower courts&#160;that have ruled against the prosecutor\'s office in this case&#160;were correct.&#160;The prosecutor\'s office withheld helpful evidence from the defense, which put&#160;an innocent man on death row.&#160;Then they try to shirk responsibility for that act. That is simply wrong. Common sense alone tells us that the role of the prosecutor is to seek justice&#160;- not&#160;convictions. If the evidence is that a person didn\'t commit a crime, then the prosecutors should say so. Criminal justice should&#160;never be a game played by prosecutors, who will stop at nothing to win. Instead, it should be about fairness. Without fairness in the&#160;system, there can be no justice. And that means justice for all. When prosecutors don\'t play fair, they should be punished. Just like raising a child, punishment serves as a proper means to teach that child right and wrong. In this case, the prosecutors were wrong and should be punished. That punishment is a large verdict against them.&#160;It hits them where it hurts - the wallet. Sometimes, that&#160;is the only language prosecutors understand.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Criminal law has a lot of complexities that may be difficult to understand without trained legal guidance.&#160; If you are facing immunity charges in Ohio, contact a <a href="http://www.ohio-criminal-lawyer.com/aop/Ohio-Criminal-Law/">Cleveland criminal lawyer</a> from the law firm of Robey and Robey today by calling toll free 888.228.5545 or submitting your <a title="case online" href="http://www.ohio-criminal-lawyer.com/contact-us/" target="&#95;self">case online</a>.</p><p /><p /><!--more--><p>The <a title="Ohio criminal defense lawyers" href="http://www.ohio-criminal-lawyer.com/ohio-criminal-cases/" target="&#95;self">Ohio criminal defense lawyers</a> of Robey &amp; Robey law inform you about the U.S. supreme court case of Connick v.

It has been\r\nthe policy of the SCTPVA to impose the administrative fee in all cases, even\r\nthose cases in which drivers have had their tickets for certain equipment\r\nviolations dismissed upon the showing of proof that the necessary repairs were\r\ndone within the timeframe of state law. </p>\r\n\r\n<p margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">On December &#160;17, 2013,\r\nthe Suffolk County Legislature voted to approve a law that will prohibit the\r\nSCTPVA from assessing an administrative fee in those cases in which drivers are\r\nfound not guilty or their tickets are dismissed. The County reportedly will\r\nissue refunds to those drivers who already have paid an administrative fee for\r\ndismissed tickets. The &#8220;not so good news&#8221; is that the SCTPVA will make up for\r\nthis loss of revenue by increasing the administrative fee for drivers who are\r\nfound guilty or plead guilty to tickets. The amount of the increase in the administrative\r\nfee&#160;will be&#160;small. However, the total amount of fine and fees for guilty pleas can be\r\nquite substantial.

aS"A que atenerse o que hacer si le han arrestado Si le han arrestado, no se asuste. Llame al Abogado Jonathan Torres. Como ciudadano goza usted de muchos derechos en virtud de la Constitucion de los Estados Unidos y de la de Florida. Tiene derecho a no declarar y a ser asistido por un Abogado. Si no puede pagar a un Abogado la Corte le senalara uno (es decir, un Abogado) por medio de la oficina del Defensor publico. NUNCA renuncia a sus derechos. No oculte su identidad, pues si lo hace no podra salir de la carcel bajo fianza. Muchas veces cuando una persona es arrestada se le da automaticamente libertad bajo fianza antes de su primera comparecencia ante el Juez. Si esto le sucede a usted considere si puede depositar la fianza. Las carceles no son agradables. Se supone que debe haber una primera comparecencia ante el Juez dentro de las primeras 24 horas de haber sido detenido. Durante la primera comparecencia el Juez revisara el affidavit en el que se contienen los cargos existentes contra usted y determinara si hay indicios de culpabilidad. La corte puede entonces determinar la fianza, si es procedente (apropiado). Normalmente la Corte establecera la fianza en la cantidad que la tabla de fianza determine. Sin embargo, el Juez puede aumentar o disminuir la fianza atendiendo a las circunstancias. El proposito de la comparecencia inicial es determinar si existen o no indicios de delito para prorrogar la detencion por la infraccion por la que ha sido detenido. Aunque el Juez determine que no existen indicios, el Estado puede todavia pedir tiempo adicional para establecer si existen tales indicios. El juez puede acordar un plazo adicional de 24 horas para que se de los affidavit o la Corte puede denegar la solicitud del Estado y dejar en libertad a la persona bajo su propia responsabilidad. Si la persona es libertada porque no hay indicios racionales de delito esto no significa que se le haya declarado no culpable. Significa que el gobierno no puede mantenerle en la carcel o impedir que constituya fianza pendiente el resultado del caso. El gobierno puede todavia acusarle mas tarde de la comision de un delito. Si se encuentran indicios racionales de delito, entonces el Juez considerara que forma de libertad provisional previa al juicio se establecera. En la mayor parte de los delitos usted tiene derecho a una fianza razonable. Hay excepciones cuando los delitos de los que se le acusa son capitales como homicidio u otros. La Corte considerara factores tales como la naturaleza del delito, los vinculos que tiene con la comunidad, situacion economica, antecedentes penales (criminales) y riesgo de fuga. Aun si se le admite prestar fianza, el Juez puede establecer restricciones en su libertad y a su abogado puede acertar a mitigar dichas condiciones. Se puede constituir la fianza personalmente o contratarse a un fiador para que la establezca en su nombre (es decir, en nombre de usted). La ventaja de constituir una fianza es que puede usted confiar en recuperar casi todo su dinero si los cargos son rechazados o se le encuentra no culpable. La desventaja es que ha de desprenderse de ese dinero hasta que el caso termine. Esto puede afectar su capacidad de pagar al Abogado y de pagar otras facturas. Al contratar a un fiador se le ofrece a usted la oportunidad de constituir fianza con un desembolso de dinero mucho menor. Por ejemplo, si se admitiera fianza por dos mil (2.000) dolares, podria contratar un fiador por unos doscientos (200) y se le dejaria en libertad bajo fianza. La desventaja es que una vez que ha pagado al fiador su tarifa no es reembolsable. Si usted se halla todavia en la carcel, hay unos plazos de los que debe ser consciente. El primer numero importante que recordar es &#8220;21&#8221;. Una persona que este en la carcel debe acusada mediante la formulacion de cargos o informacion de los mismos dentro del plazo de 21 dias desde el arresto y si no esta en la carcel y esta bajo custodia, entonces la persona tiene derecho a una vista sobre su posible imputacion. La vista no es opcional si usted la exige, incluso si el gobierno presentara el dia 22 la documentacion requerida. La vista es importantisima para usted por los siguientes motivos. Primero la Corte esta obligada a celebrar la vista dandole a usted todos los beneficios del procedimiento debido, a saber: formular repreguntas, el derecho a llamar testigos, a permanecer en silencio, a testificar a su favor. El Estado no puede fundamentarse solo en el informe policial, necesitara tener testigos. De nuevo, la Corte precisara determinar en cuanto a los posibles cargos. La Corte puede no encontrar ninguno y ponerle en libertad bajo su responsabilidad. Recuerde, una declaracion sobre posible ausencia de cargos no equivale a declararle usted no culpable. Todavia el gobierno puede acusarle de la comision de un delito. Aun encontrando indicios de criminalidad la Corte puede reducir la fianza con base en la solidez de la evidencia contra usted. Por supuesto, tambien puede aumentarla. Muchas personas carecen de la capacidad de presentar fianza y permanecen en la carcel treinta (30) dias despues del arresto. Muchas veces no hay demanda para celebracion de vista de determinacion de una posible imputacion. A veces el gobierno no llega a formular cargos dentro del plazo de treinta dias. En teoria se entiende que la Corte debe notificar a la oficina del Fiscal que a menos que los cargos sean presentados el dia 33, la Corte pondra en libertad a la persona bajo su propia responsabilidad. En la practica la Corte no se va a dar cuenta de que la persona ha estado en la carcel treinta (30) dias sin que se le imputaran cargos. Lo mejor seria que su abogado presentara una peticion de que se le ponga en libertad al llegar el dia trigesimo (30) y tal peticion debe presentarse ese mismo dia en el caso de que no haya sido formulada acusacion por delito. La Corte celebrara una vista el dia 33 y determinara si se hallan o no el escrito de acusacion en los archivos de la Corte. En la vista del dia 33 la Corte revisara el expediente y si se ha presentado un escrito de acusacion. Con frecuencia el escrito se ha presentado y usted volvera a la carcel. Algunas veces no se habra presentado todavia el dia 33 el escrito de acusacion. La Corte se halla obligada a ponerle en libertad bajo su propia responsabilidad a menos que el gobierno pueda mostrar buenas razones por las que el escrito no haya sido presentado. La Corte puede acordar una prorroga de siete (7) dias. Sin embargo, en ningun caso puede la persona ser retenida por mas de 40 dias. Los Abogados experimentados recomendaran a sus clientes esperar hasta el dia 41 para presentar la solicitud de puesta en libertad. La ley establece claramente que debe ser puesto en libertad si no se han presentado formalmente cargos dentro de los cuarenta (40) dias. Llame al Abogado Jonathan Torres.

aS'Media PA personal injury lawyer, George Rassias of Schmidt, Kirifides &amp; Fridkin settled a home health aid&#8217;s slip and fall case against a homeowner with poor step configuration for $25,000 pre-suit. The matter involved our client who sustained a fractured foot requiring immobilization when she suffered a fall while exiting a client&#8217;s home through a garage door with an insufficient landing. Our client underwent weeks of casting and non-weight bearing followed by approximately twenty (20) physical therapy visits. She also subsequently complained of shoulder discomfort and underwent some physical therapy for that as well. She responded to conservative treatments and returned to work.\r\nThere were causation concerns over the shoulder complaints, and comparative negligence issues were likely to arise. In resolving the case prior to incurring litigation costs, we were able to maximize our client&#8217;s recovery with a fair and reasonable settlement and avoid incurring not only additional costs associated with full blown litigation in a disputed liability slip and fall lawsuit, but also bring the case to closure within a year from the date of injury.\r\n\r\nMedia PA Personal Injury Lawyers of Schmidt, Kirifides &amp; Fridkin Handle Slip &amp; Fall Lawsuits\r\n\r\nThe personal injury lawyers at Schmidt, Kirifides &amp; Fridkin have been representing injured individuals for over 20 years and are dedicated to pursuing fair and reasonable settlements for our client&#8217;s recovery.

aS'<strong>Michigan No-Fault attorney stresses that you should purchase the additional &#8220;optional&#8221; insurance coverage offered by out-of-state rental car agencies</strong><a href="http://www.michiganautolaw.com/auto-lawyers-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/teen-driver.jpg"></a><p>It&#8217;s that time of the year again, when parents start fretting and high school and college students are wired for spring break trips. Our <a title="Michigan No-Fault insurance law" href="http://www.michiganautolaw.com/caraccidents/nofaultbasics.php" target="&#95;self">no fault auto insurance attorneys</a> want to help keep students and travelers safe this season by reviewing some important auto insurance issues.</p><p>First and most important, there are more than a hundred auto insurance companies writing Michigan No-Fault policies, and my advice can&#8217;t possibly apply to all of them, so&#160; it&#8217;s best to call your auto insurance agent before a trip, to see how your No-Fault coverage applies in case of an auto accident out of state.</p><p>That aside, most drivers have no idea if they should purchase the additional insurance offered by rental car companies. When it comes to renting a car &#8211; especially when we&#8217;re talking about out-of-state rental cars &#8211; No-Fault insurance attorneys&#160; will almost always recommend purchasing rental car coverage.</p><strong>Why purchase rental car insurance coverage if I have No-Fault insurance in Michigan?</strong><p>The big reason is car damage.&#160; With most No-Fault policies today, there is an open question on whether the car damage to a rental car will be covered by your own auto No-Fault policy, even if you have purchased collision coverage for your vehicle. Ask your insurance agent about car damage and whether the coverage on your personal vehicle extends to a rental car. In many cases, renters are not appropriately covered and should purchase the additional insurance to minimize the risk. Even if a car accident is not your fault, you don&#8217;t want to get stuck with a $20,000 bill for vehicle repairs.</p><p>Most rental car companies offer customers the option to purchase additional coverage such as:</p><ul><li>Collision damage coverage</li><li>Personal accident insurance</li><li>Supplemental liability protection</li></ul><strong>The risk of relying on your Michigan No-Fault insurance policy when renting cars out of state</strong><p>The good news is if you have No-Fault in Michigan and you are injured in a car accident in another state, you will still be able to collect <a title="Michigan No-Fault benefits" href="http://www.michiganautolaw.com/caraccidents/caraccidentbenefits.php" target="&#95;self">No-Fault benefits</a> - currently the nation&#8217;s best - for medical bills, wage loss, replacement services, mileage, and attendant care. But for out-of-state rental use, the main risks of only relying on your own Michigan No-Fault insurance policy and not purchasing the additional rental coverage include uninsured and underinsured coverage, the possibility of a reduced bodily injury coverage that can leave you personally exposed, and as said above, car accident collision damage to the vehicle.</p><p>Also, very important insurance coverages &#8212; that our lawyers strongly recommend everyone carry &#8212; such as <a title="Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage" href="http://www.michiganautolaw.com/caraccidents/uninsured-motorist-coverage/index.php" target="&#95;self">uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage</a>, may not transfer over to the rental car you are driving if you become seriously injured in a car accident.&#160; Again, check and find out before you leave with your agent.</p><p>As a final note, check your credit card.&#160; Some credit card companies will pay for vehicle damage if the rental car is purchased on their card.</p><p>In general, as with most insurance contracts, rental car insurance policies are deliberately written to be confusing. They also include a lot of exceptions and exclusions that, combined with the exceptions and exclusions of your own auto No-Fault policy, have been the subject of many seminars for lawyers and insurance adjusters on what is and isn&#8217;t covered.</p><p>Insurance policies and contracts for rental cars change often. If you are on the fence, it&#8217;s safest to assume with rental cars that your own Michigan No-Fault policy will likely be deficient and will not protect you fully if you&#8217;re involved in a car accident in a rental car out of state.</p><p>Our attorneys wish everyone a safe and happy spring break. Call one of our No-Fault attorneys at (800) 777-0028 if you&#8217;ve been injured in an out-of-state accident, and are concerned about your Michigan insurance rights.</p><p><a href="http://www.michiganautolaw.com/">Michigan Personal Injury Attorney</a> Steven M.

aS'<p>\r\nAugust 12, 2010-According to reports the San Gabriel man that was charged in the drunk driving crash that killed Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart claims he did not intend to get behind the wheel.\r\n\r\n</p><p>According to Andrew Thomas Gallo&#8217;s attorney Jaqueline Goodman in a motion to dismiss claims stems from the fact that Gallow had a designated driver the day of the crash, but ended up driving have his step brother that was his designated driver got drunk on beer and tequila. The pair went to two bars and in the 12 page motion to dismiss the grand jury indictment charging Gallow with three counts of second degree murder. </p><p>According to police, Gallo&#8217;s blood alcohol level was almost three times over the legal limit. \r\n\r\nThe charges stem from the April 2009 crash that killed Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart and two other people, resulting in three counts of second degree murder. His attorney states he did not possess the intended malice, since he did not plan to get behind the wheel and had a designated driver. </p><p>The crash killed Nick Adenhart age 22, Courtney Stewart age 20 and Henry Pearson age 25. Jon White age 24 also a passenger in the Mitsubishi Eclipse Stewart was driving was seriously injured in the crash. \r\n\r\nSusan Price Deputy District attorney accused the 22 year old under the implied malice, since he knew driving under the influence was dangerous to other people. </p><p>Price also stated Gallo chose to drive and has had a prior driving under the influence conviction. She stated it did not matter whether he planned to drive or not, he did get behind the wheel, running a red light that resulted in the death of three people at a Fullerton intersection. \r\n\r\n</p><p>Price stated Gallo admitted after the crash, when he found out three people had died that he should have called a girlfriend to pick them up. Price said this shows that Gallo knew he should not be driving under the influence and he knew he was wrong.\r\n\r\n</p><p>If Gallo is convicted of the three counts of second degree murder he can be sentenced up to 50 years in prison, without parole. If convicted of three counts of manslaughter he could face 15 years in prison with parole possible after approximately 12 years. \r\n\r\nThis has been another public service message from the </p><a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/">Los Angeles accident attorney</a> at:\r\n\r\n<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&q=los+angeles+accident+attorney&fb=1&gl=us&hq=accident+attorney&hnear=Los+Angeles,+CA&ei=l8JkTMz&#95;NYzmiwPt3uT-Dw&ved=0CIUBEKUG&view=map&cid=3000622511751972843&iwloc=A&sa=X">Ehline Law\r\n633 West 5th Street\r\nLos Angeles, CA 90071</a>\r\n(213) 596-9642\r\n\r\n201 Wilshire Blvd., Second Floor\r\nSanta Monica, CA 90401\r\n(310) 376-8488\r\nBus: Wilshire / 4th\r\n<br /><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&q=los+angeles+accident+attorney&fb=1&gl=us&hq=accident+attorney&hnear=Los+Angeles,+CA&ei=l8JkTMz&#95;NYzmiwPt3uT-Dw&ved=0CIUBEKUG&view=map&cid=3000622511751972843&t=h&ll=34.051077,-118.254561&spn=0.005334,0.006437&z=16&iwloc=A&source=embed">View Larger Map</a><!--more-->More details on the <a href="http://losangelesinjurylawyers.blogspot.com/2010/08/driver-involved-in-angels-pitcher-nick.html">wrongful death of Nick Adenhart</a> from the <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/" title="los angeles accident attorney">Los Angeles accident attorney</a> at Ehline Law.'

aS'<p>We handle all types of employment claims &#8211; but we rarely see a good &#8216;wrongful termination&#8217; claim.&#160; That&#8217;s not because there aren&#8217;t a good number of terminations that are wrong, or unfair, but because <a href="http://www.ezoldlaw.com/">Pennsylvania wrongful termination laws</a> are very limited.&#160; These laws apply to the entire Commonwealth; for instance, although Philadelphia has some local ordinances that protect employees under limited circumstances, but do not protect employees against wrongful terminations.</p><p>The reality of employment is that it is often unfair; terminations for no reason or because your boss doesn&#8217;t like you, discipline that is unevenly handed out, favoritism, nepotism, and fear-based management styles are all examples.&#160; Just because an action is unfair does not make it illegal, however.&#160; Pennsylvania (like most states) follows the &#8216;employment at will&#8217; doctrine.&#160; In other words, an employer can fire or discipline an employee in Pennsylvania for any reason, for a bad or ridiculous reason, for an unfair reason or for no reason at all.&#160; &#8216;At will&#8217; employment can benefit employees who want to leave; an employee can quit at any time, without notice and without any good reason, and go immediately to work elsewhere (even for a competitor, assuming there is no noncompetition agreement or trade secret issue).</p><p>The &#8216;at will&#8217; doctrine is very strong in Pennsylvania; for instance, it generally allows an employer to ignore the terms of their own handbook in setting wages, employee responsibilities, discipline and termination procedures.&#160; An employer&#8217;s handbook is not a contract; they can change the conditions of your employment at will and without notice, regardless of what the handbook says.&#160; For instance, you can work for a manufacturing company in Philadelphia with a thorough book of employment policies, including their own written &#8216;three strikes&#8217; policy before termination, and yet be fired on the spot without warning &#8211; for something that the employer admits is not your fault.&#160;&#160; In fact, Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held that Pennsylvania law &#8220;does not prohibit firing an employee for relying on an employer&#8217;s promise.&#8221;</p><p>This seems very unfair to most people.&#160; Every kid on the playground knows that if you set a rule, it is unfair if you don&#8217;t follow it yourself &#8211; and yet, in the real world (at least in Pennsylvania), there are generally no consequences when an employer ignores their own rules.</p><p>There is a limit to this unfairness, however.&#160; First, the terms of an employment contract can limit an employer&#8217;s &#8216;at will&#8217; rights.&#160; For instance, if you negotiate a contract that states you cannot be fired without cause, the &#8216;at will&#8217; standard no longer applies.&#160; Second, &#8216;at will&#8217; employment does not mean that an employer can break other laws; for instance, <a href="http://www.ezoldlaw.com/attorneys/chris/">no employer may discriminate</a> against, sexually harass or deny vested benefits to an employee (this is where some of Philadelphia&#8217;s extra protections come into play).&#160; Finally, the &#8216;at will&#8217; standard can be overridden by a Pennsylvania court&#8217;s view of public policy.</p><p>&#8216;Public policy&#8217; is truly where &#8216;unfair&#8217; becomes &#8216;wrongful termination.&#8217;&#160; In essence, there are some very limited circumstances that are so fundamentally unfair as to give rise to a claim for wrongful termination in Pennsylvania &#8211; regardless of the &#8216;at will&#8217; doctrine.&#160; Pennsylvania courts don&#8217;t necessarily use the term &#8216;unfair,&#8217; however &#8211; instead they will allow a claim for wrongful termination if it violates &#8216;public policy.&#8217;</p><p>What is public policy?&#160; What do Pennsylvania courts find so objectionable, so unfair, as to override the at-will doctrine?&#160;&#160; This area of the law is still developing, but there are some clear examples set by the courts.&#160; These examples can be categorized as follows (these categories are of my own creation and are not set forth explicitly in case law; they are a tool to assist in general understanding of the law):</p><p>Civic Duties:&#160; Pennsylvania citizens have obligations to the public, such as the obligation not to commit a crime, to serve as a juror when called, etc.&#160; Pennsylvania courts have seen these duties as a strong public policy.&#160; Therefore, if you are terminated for refusing to commit a crime, refusing to commit perjury, serving jury duty, or for reporting a health or safety hazard that you are obligated by statute to report, then you can sue for wrongful termination.&#160; </p><p>Personal Rights:&#160; This is a tricky area; there are few &#8216;personal rights&#8217; that can affect an at-will&#8217; relationship.&#160; However, some personal rights which are set forth in a statute &#8211; a written law &#8211; can be the basis for &#8216;public policy&#8217;.&#160; For instance, Pennsylvania law states that an employer may not require an employee to take a lie detector test to maintain employment or become employed.&#160; Pennsylvania courts have held that terminating an employee for refusing a lie detector test is a violation of public policy, and gives rise to a wrongful termination claim.&#160; Similarly, terminating an employee for not disclosing a pardoned conviction is a violation of public policy.&#160; I believe that Pennsylvania courts will eventually reach the conclusion that certain areas of an employee&#8217;s private life (who you vote for, what is in your private communications, certain medical information) are also protected &#8211; but this has not yet happened.</p><p>Employment Compacts:&#160; Pennsylvania employees enjoy access to unemployment compensation and workman&#8217;s compensation programs.&#160; The courts feel that these programs represent a compact between employers and workers.&#160; For instance, a worker is generally not allowed to sue their employer for injuries on the job, and in exchange, they receive workman&#8217;s compensation.&#160; Pennsylvania courts believe that allowing employers to terminate employees for using these systems undermines the systems and robs the employees of their end of the compact.&#160; Therefore, if you are terminated for applying for unemployment (generally in the past), or for applying for workmen&#8217;s compensation, you can sue for wrongful termination.&#160; Furthermore, if you are terminated for filing a claim under Pennsylvania&#8217;s Wage Payment and Collection Law, you can sue for wrongful termination (although there is a split in the law which may allow an employer to terminate you for demanding wages due, but before you sue &#8211; seems silly, but true).</p><p>It must be stressed that public policy is not &#8216;what the courts think is good for the public,&#8217; but what the courts believe is the public policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.&#160; The courts will look to Pennsylvania statutory law, regulations and constitution to determine what is &#8216;public policy.&#8217;&#160; The courts also need to find that the public policy mandate is &#8216;clear.&#8217;</p><p>What is the reality for the average employee in Pennsylvania?&#160; It means that your employer generally does not have to treat you fairly.&#160; Is that bad management?&#160; It certainly is.&#160; Is that right?&#160; It certainly isn&#8217;t.&#160; Is that illegal?&#160; Probably not.&#160; The reality is that the best safeguard you have is not the law, but making sure that you have other jobs to go to.&#160; Never tie yourself to an employer so completely that you don&#8217;t know what else is out there, and don&#8217;t have the skills to work anywhere else.&#160; That way, when your employer is unfair, you can find an employer who has more appreciation for you and its other employees.</p><p>HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?</p><p>I&#8217;m writing this blog because I have a passion for the work I do.&#160;

aS'<p><strong>Grounds for Divorce in Arizona</strong></p><p>A marriage is a legal contract between two people. If the &#8220;contract&#8221; is broken then a legal procedure must follow to properly document the dissolution of marriage. Marriages end for various reasons. Every state has a different set of <a href="http://www.aboutdivorce.org/state&#95;divorce&#95;laws.html" target="&#95;blank">divorce laws</a> and statutes. In Arizona there are two main grounds for divorce, which greatly vary based on the type of marriage.&#160; </p><p><strong>No-Fault Grounds for Divorce</strong></p><p>One type of the dissolution of marriage is the no-fault grounds. This is when both parties mutually agree that the marriage is irretrievably broken. This means that both parties have come to the decision that the dissolution of marriage is due to the fact that their marriage is broken beyond repair.&#160; </p><p><strong>Fault Grounds for Divorce </strong></p><p>The second and more complicated grounds for divorce only apply to covenant marriages. A covenant marriage is also known as a higher marriage. This type of marriage is offered in many states. It was basically created to make the process harder for the couple to get a divorce, which in hopes would decrease the amount of divorces. When the couple marries they must state the reason that they are allowed to get divorced, which is stated when they get their marriage license. This justification for divorce is considered a fault divorce. There must be an acceptable reason for the divorce, which includes adultery, drug, alcohol or physical abuse, commitment of a felony, abandonment, or an extended period of separation. A fault divorce, or covenant marriage divorce, typically is a longer and more detailed process.</p><p><strong>The Divorce Process</strong></p><p>If you are considering a divorce you should contact your local family law firm for more information.

The same requirement is also expected from motorcycle accident attorneys and truck accident lawyers likewise.

This is a grieve mistake as they first have to realize that there are many factors that contribute to the defect of tires, other than the usual manufacturing fault. Theres a list that is compiled to ease clients in better understanding the different defects of tires that are found and the relevant parties involved.</p><p dir="ltr" /><p dir="ltr">Old tires Tires that are kept for a long time could start deteriorating, even without being used. Retailers could misinform their buyers and have old tires sold to them as new ones, but lawyers are able to run extensive checks and gather relevant information on the age of the tire.</p><p dir="ltr" /><p dir="ltr">Tread separation The defect has been placed under the medias spotlight with manufacturers recalling the defective tires. During a tread separation, where the main rubber frame is separated from the actual steel belt that holds it in place. This often leads to a blowout, where drivers lose control of the car and could lead to fatal accident. In the manufacturing process, improper supervision of work or inspections could have caused the tire to be distributed with defect.</p><p dir="ltr" /><p dir="ltr">Incompatible tires Tires might not have defects themselves, but if theyre incompatible with the vehicle, it could bring about equally detrimental accidents that arise from tire defects. Along the assembly line, there could many errors that could be made when strict regulations arent adhered. Car accident lawyers will be able to determine if the accident was caused by the installation of incompatible tires.</p><p dir="ltr" /><p dir="ltr">After identifying the relevant parties that could be responsible for the tire defect, victims are able to file claims to seek compensation. Either to cover medical cost or property damage, an effective lawsuit could take place after discussions are made with a personal injury lawyer.

aS"<p>We often hear about relationships resulting in a breach of &quot;fiduciary duty.&quot;&#160; But does the general public know what type of relationship gives rise to a fiduciary duty in the first place?&#160; The purpose of this post is to provide&#160;the reader&#160;with a better understanding of the type of relationship to which will attach a &quot;fiduciary duty.&quot;</p><p>Perhaps it would be beneficial to approach the topic from the back end, i.e., to first start with a clear understanding of what a&#160;&quot;fiduciary duty&quot; is.&#160; A good definition of the term under Texas Law can be found&#160;in the 1997&#160;<u>Arce v. Burrow</u> opinion out of the Fourteenth Court of Appeals.&#160; There, the court stated that &quot;<em>[A] fiduciary duty is a formal, technical relationship of confidence and trust imposing great duties upon a fiduciary as a matter of law.&quot;&#160; </em></p><p>We can go all the way back to the 1942 Texas Supreme Court case of <em><u>Kinzbach Tool</u> <u>Co. v. Corbett-Wallace Corp.</u></em>&#160;for a description of the type of relationship necessary to create a fiduciary duty.&#160;&#160; There, the court&#160;stated the following:</p><p><em>&quot;[T]he term &quot;fiduciary is derived from the civil law.&#160; It is impossible to give a definition of the term that is comprehensive enough to cover all areas.&#160; Generally&#160;speaking, it applies to any person who occupies a position of peculiar confidence towards another.&#160; It refers to integrity and fidelity.&#160; It contemplates fair dealing and good faith, rather than legal obligation, as the basis of the transaction. The term includes those informal relations which exist whenever one party trusts and relies upon another, as well as technical fiduciary relations.&quot;</em></p><p>A fiduciary duty may arise formally, as a matter of law, or informally, through moral, social, domestic, or purely personal relationships of trust and confidence.&#160; As a matter of law, Texas recognizes the following relationships as giving rise to fiduciary duties:</p><ul><li><strong>attorney-client</strong>, a highly fiduciary relationship in which the dealings between the attorney and the client are subject to exacting scrutiny;</li><li><strong>partners</strong>, where the Texas Supreme Court has commented that <em>&quot;[W]e have long recognized as a matter of common law that the relationship between partners is fiduciary in character, and imposes upon all participants the obligation of loyalty to the joint concern and of the utmost good faith, fairness, and honesty in their dealings with each other with respect to the matters pertaining to the enterprise;&quot;</em></li><li><strong>spouses, </strong>where one spouse breaches the&#160;relationship of trust&#160;and commits fraud on the community by conveying community property to third parties;</li><li><strong>agent/principal,</strong> as Texas follows the common law of most jurisdictions in holding that agency is a special relationship that gives rise to a fiduciary duty because the agent, in agreeing to act on behalf of the principal, causes the agent to be a fiduciary;</li><li><strong>officers and directors to a corporation,</strong> with the courts of Texas generally holding that the officers and directors are, while exercising their official actions,&#160; held to&#160;an extreme measure of candor, unselfishness, and good faith;</li><li><strong>trustee of trust/executor of estate,</strong> as both owe full disclosure of all material facts known to them that might affect the rights of the beneficiaries; and</li><li><strong>employer to employee (in certain cases),</strong> where some employees have been required to disgorge the profit they received from a person with whom they were dealing on behalf of their employer.</li></ul><p>The list is not necessarily exhaustive, but does highlight those relationships that the law has clearly attached fiduciary duties.&#160; </p><p>One final note concerning the existence of one of these relationships and a breach of fiduciary claim.&#160; The plaintiff is in an enviable position because Texas courts apply a <u>rebuttable presumption of unfairness</u> to transactions between&#160;the fiduciary and the party to whom he owes a duty of disclosure.&#160;</p><p>&#160;On the other hand, there are informal&#160;relationships that the law has declared not to be fiduciary as a matter of law.&#160; That list includes:</p><ul><li><strong>insurer and third-party claimant;</strong></li><li><strong>lender and borrower </strong>(unless the borrower is able to show extraordinary circumstances such as excessive control and influence by the lender on the borrower's business);</li><li><strong>general contractor and subcontractor;</strong> and</li><li><strong>mortgagor-mortgagee.</strong></li></ul><p>In holding that these relationships do not impose fiduciary duties on one of the parties, the courts have held that the law must examine &quot;<em>whether influence has been</em> <em>acquired and abused</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>whether confidence has been reposed and betrayed</em>.&quot;&#160; Quite simply, the law doses not recognize a fiduciary relationship lightly, with the ultimate determination predicated on the circumstances of each case.&#160; In most of these cases, the existence of an informal fiduciary relationship is a question of fact for the jury.&#160; More often than not, the party that asserts a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty arising from an alleged informal relationship fails to overcome the high threshold required to assert such a claim.</p><p>So now you know, or if you already knew, perhaps you have a better understanding of what makes a fiduciary relationship.&#160; Quite simply, it's not easy to attain the status of a fiduciary relationship, but once there, significant duties attach.</p><p>Nothing in this post should be considered legal advice.&#160; Let's face it, chances are good that you may not know me and I may not know you. My aim is simply to provide the reader with some useful, but general, information about the topic.&#160; You should not rely on any information in this post without some assurance that the material is still current and applicable at the time it is read.&#160; If you want a legal opinion that has teeth, consult your personal lawyer about your particular circumstances.&#160; If you don't have a lawyer and like what you see here, perhaps you should contact my law office to determine if I might be a good fit for you.&#160; To do so, simply click on my name above and you will be directed to my website, or you can reach me by telephone at<strong>(713) 626-2221.</strong>&#160; When responding please refer to this <strong>Blog No. 43.</strong></p><p /><p />"

aS'<p>A short sale is a transaction where the lender who owns the mortgage on a property agrees to mark down the principal of the loan.&#160; The lender does this in exchange for the homeowner selling the property and taking nothing from the closing table.&#160; The ultimate benefit to the lender is that a high risk loan is removed from its books and hopefully it will be able to reinvest those funds into a more secure investment.</p><p>Shortsales are often necessary where a homeowner is upside down on the value of the property.&#160; What many homeowners do not understand is whether there will be liability after the shortsale.&#160; </p><p>Most often the lender will no longer be able to come after the homeowner, but there may be liability to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) if the balance of the loan is written off by the lender.&#160; If this happens, the IRS will consider the balance of the loan which was not repaid as income to the homeowner.</p><p>There are some exceptions to this rule, but most frequently a thorough analysis is required before concluding one way or the other.</p><p><a href="http://www.trivediandassociates.com/">www.trivediandassociates.com</a></p>'

aS'<p>History buffs will remember a famous expression that grew out of a disastrous Liberty Digest magazine poll in 1936. That poll predicted a landslide for Republican Alf Landon over Democrat <a title="Franklin D.

This presents interesting choice of law questions. The auto insurance rules are governed by Massachusetts because it was a Massachusetts policy on the vehicle.

Moreover, since the <a title="Auto Accident Lawsuit in Boston" href="http://www.feinbergalban.com/practice-areas/auto-accidents/" target="&#95;blank">accident</a> is brought in Massachusetts, where the parties reside, the Massachusetts court will have to use the laws of the state of the accident.</p><p>Practically speaking, the rules of the road do not vary much between the states. However, the fact that jurisdiction can be brought in Massachusetts is a big plus to the parties. That is not always the case as jurisdiction has to be where the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts. If the driver were from out-of-state and the accident occurred out-of-state, the action could not be brought in Massachusetts despite the plaintiff&#8217;s living here.

aS'When people get behind the wheel of a vehicle and head out onto the \r\npublic roads, their ability to arrive at their destination safely \r\ndepends mostly on their ability to negotiate certain driving \r\nenvironments and to make the correct decisions that need to be made \r\nwithin those driving environments. One of the most difficult situations \r\nfor any driver to encounter based on the number of choices that must be \r\nmade is at an intersection. People tend to take for granted all that \r\nmust go right in this situation, but if anyone makes even a slight \r\nmistake the situation can quickly devolve into a disaster.&#160;&#160;\r\n<p>Below you will find a brief overview of the scenarios that tend to arise at intersections that lead to <a href="http://www.mglawyers.com/san-diego-auto-accidents-lawyers.html" title="San Diego car accidents">San Diego car accidents</a>\r\n that result in injuries and fatalities. You will also find information \r\nregarding how those who make mistakes at intersections can and should be\r\n held liable for the damages they cause. Anyone who has been harmed in \r\nthis manner needs to obtain the help of experienced San Diego personal \r\ninjury lawyers as soon as possible.</p>\r\nExamples of Intersection Mistakes\r\n<p>There are several different types of intersections that a driver will\r\n encounter during any given trip, and each of these different \r\nintersections presents different decisions that must be made correctly. \r\nFor instance, a four-way stop intersection involves people understanding\r\n the proper order in which they should proceed, and if anyone moves out \r\nof order the situation can quickly lead to a serious crash, most often \r\nwith someone being broad-sided.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to four-way stop environments, intersections where \r\nsomeone is attempting to turn left across traffic and onto another road \r\nalso lead to a high number of crashes. That&#8217;s because the person turning\r\n may not see someone coming in the other direction or they may misjudge \r\nthe speed at which that motorist is approaching. Once again, these \r\ncrashes tend to be violent and usually involve the side of the turning \r\nvehicle being impacted.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the most egregious mistakes that tend to be made at \r\nintersections involve motorists who run through yellow or red lights. \r\nWhen someone makes this mistake, it often leads to a serious crash both \r\nbecause the other motorist did not expect such a maneuver from that \r\ndriver and because these crashes tend to occur at high rates of speed.</p>\r\nHow San Diego Personal Injury Lawyers Can Help\r\n<p>People who are injured in intersection crashes who intend to hold \r\nthose responsible for their injuries accountable need to take immediate \r\nsteps to protect their legal rights. However, this is often easier said \r\nthan done because someone in this position is already fighting through \r\nserious injuries and because they do not possess legal backgrounds. \r\nHowever, successful claims can result in an award of damages for that \r\ninjured person.</p>\r\n<p>If you or someone you love has been injured in an intersection crash, you need to seek the help of <a href="http://www.mglawyers.com/san-diego-personal-injury.html" title="San Diego personal injury lawyers">San Diego personal injury lawyers</a> who have been fighting for the rights of clients for many years.

aS"<p>Every now and then (or perhaps more often than we like to think) a Supervisor will fill out the SF 3112B (Supervisor's Statement) with such venom and innuendo and half-truths, as to make the disability retirement applicant out to be John Gotti's half-brother and reincarnate of the conceptual paradigm of the greatest incompetent the Federal Government has ever seen (next to the Supervisor himself, of course). &#160;Or, it will state that the applicant has been &quot;under investigation&quot;, or that he/she has &quot;mislead&quot; the Agency, or other such half-truth, unsubstantiated allegation. &#160;The problem in addressing such a Supervisor's Statement with the Office of Personnel Management (if, in fact, one has the opportunity to address the issue before it gets to OPM or, as is more often the case, if the disability retirement application is denied, and the Supervisor's Statement is referenced in the initial decision of denial), is the following: &#160;If you address it too forcefully, or emphasize it, then you are in danger of focusing the &quot;fight&quot; on the truth or falsity of what the Supervisor has said. &#160;In other words, you have essentially allowed the Supervisor to win the fight by shifting your focus upon the venom of the Supervisor. It is more likely the wiser course of action to grant minimal attention to the Supervisor's Statement; give it the due response it deserves, addressing the falsity of the statement, and how it is entirely unsubstantiated; and, sometimes, express outrage that OPM would have even considered such scandalous charges when it has been unverified; then focus most of the attention upon the validity and force of the Medical Narrative Report that accompanies the disability retirement application. &#160;For, after all, always remember that this is a &quot;Medical Disability Retirement Application&quot; -- with the emphasis upon &quot;medical&quot;, and not &quot;Supervisor&quot;.</p><p>Sincerely, Robert R.

Some of these drugs include the following: </p><ul><li><a title="Dilantin Stevens Johnson Syndrome" href="http://www.usasjslawyers.com/sjs-overview/dilantin-stevens-johnson-syndrome/" target="&#95;blank">Dilantin&#160;Stevens Johnson Syndrome</a>: Dilantin is an anticonvulsant that recently has been linked as a Stevens Johnson Syndrome cause. Since 1998, there have been a number of reports of children developing SJS due to the anticonvulsant Dilantin. Recent research shows that the risk of SJS increased with the usage of Dilantin as opposed to other anticonvulsants.</li><li><a title="Motrin Stevens Johnson Syndrome" href="http://www.usasjslawyers.com/sjs-overview/motrin-stevens-johnson-syndrome/" target="&#95;blank">Motrin&#160;Stevens Johnson Syndrome</a>: Motrin, a brand name for the generic drug ibuprofen, has recently been recognized by doctors as one of the causes of SJS. Motrin-induced SJS may cause terrible skin reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis.</li><li><a title="Advil Stevens Johnson Syndrome" href="http://www.usasjslawyers.com/sjs-overview/advil-stevens-johnson-syndrome/" target="&#95;blank">Advil&#160;Stevens Johnson Syndrome</a>: Like Motrin, Advil is a brand name for ibuprofen. Recently Advil has been linked with causing SJS, especially in children where children&#8217;s Advil has been involved. A major concern today is that SJS caused by children&#8217;s Advil may result in rapid blindness or death. Because of these dangers, drug manufacturers have been pressed to add more warnings to their product, specifically addressing the side effects that are linked to SJS. </li><li><a title="Bextra Stevens Johnson Syndrome" href="http://www.usasjslawyers.com/sjs-overview/bextra-stevens-johnson-syndrome/" target="&#95;blank">Bextra&#160;Stevens Johnson Syndrome</a>: Bextra is banned in both Canada and Europe. In 2005, the FDA asked Pfizer, the maker of Bextra, to take it off the market. One of the reasons for the decision of the FDA was that major side effects including heart attacks and strokes occurred more often for patients taking Bextra than for other COX-2 agents. These COX-2 agents have been shown to increase the risk of contracting SJS. </li><li><a title="Feldene Stevens Johnson Syndrome" href="http://www.usasjslawyers.com/sjs-overview/feldene-stevens-johnson-syndrome/" target="&#95;blank">Feldene&#160;Stevens Johnson Syndrome</a>: Feldene, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation. The drug piroxicam is the generic version of Feldene, which has been around since 1982. Feldene, like the other drugs listed above, has been linked with Stevens Johnson Syndrome.

Take time to write personal notes to these special people in your life. </li><li>Be sure to give yourself a gift. It should be a pampering type gift such as a day off, a massage or manicure, a weekend getaway, or a visit with an old friend by phone or in person. </li><li>Watch: <em>It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life</em>. </li><li>Keep things simple. Limit how much you ask of yourself in terms of planning parties. Eliminate some activity that you just don&#8217;t need to do.&#160; </li><li>Exercise. Exercise releases stress and produces chemical changes in our bodies which create a sense of well-being. </li><li>Eat well and refrain from overusing alcohol. Its okay to splurge a little at a holiday party, but keep your focus on daily nutrition. Remember to eat a healthy breakfast (yogurt, strawberries, wheat toast) and a healthy lunch (grilled Atlantic salmon and green vegetables). If you feel yourself suffering from headaches, lack of energy, digestive problems, heart burn, etc., eat something &#8220;living&#8221; like fruit or vegetables. </li><li>Remember this season is spiritual. Throw yourself into your worship center. </li><li>Serve others. Studies show that service and charity produce positive, healthy changes in our minds, bodies and spirits. </li><li>Don&#8217;t spend too much. Shopping and buying gifts produces a positive feeling, but the damage of spending too much will last much longer. The high of buying is similar to the high of sugar. It is a high, but it won&#8217;t last and it will lead to a let down, particularly when the credit card bills come in. </li><li>If you find yourself in the doldrums, take out a pencil and paper and make a list of positive things happening in your life. You will be amazed at how many great things are going on in your life, even though there are some painful things going on. This is absolutely guaranteed to lift your spirits. </li><li>When dealing with the other parent, think in terms of what the children would like. Try to think about this as though the marital trouble was not happening. My experience tells me that children just really love it when their parents put their animosities to the side for special occasions. A visit to Church on Christmas Eve with the whole family would probably be something they would cherish forever. If you have superior funds to the other spouse, offer to contribute some money for Christmas gifts. Yield some special time to the other parent when possible. </li><li>Don&#8217;t expect too much. We all expect that we are supposed to feel some kind of magical joy during a holiday. This creates negative pressure. Resolve to let the joy of the holiday come to you. It cannot be created and many positive memories of the past will always be that: memories to be cherished, but perhaps never to be re-lived. And, that is okay. </li></ol>'

aS'<p>Can you garnish an employee retirement account for the purposes of collecting overdue child support?&#160; What about spousal support?</p><p>The Virginia Court of Appeals was tasked with answering this question in&#160;<em>Nkopchieu v. Minlend</em>, Record No. 0500-11-4 (2011).&#160; In that case, the parties had two children during their brief marriage.&#160; The father became obligated to pay&#160;<em>pendente lite&#160;</em>child support to the tune of $2,000.&#160; He chose to flee the country rather than pay any child support.&#160; His wife, accordingly, sought entry of a qualified domestic relations order at trial.&#160; She wanted the court to assign her some of his employee retirement benefits order at the time of their divorce so that she could collect at least some of his astronomical child support arrears ($28,163.66).<a href="file:///C:/Users/nsolan.COOCHANDLAPHAM/Desktop/Blog%20Post%20-%20QDRO%20As%20Collections%20Tool%201.22.12.doc#&#95;ftn1">[1]</a>&#160; The trial court said that it could not do so under the past precedent of&#160;<em>Hoy v.

Code &#167; 20-107.3(K)(4) because the divorce order was entered prior to July 1, 1982 and that it couldn&#8217;t have used that code section anyway to now divide up retirement benefits because to do so serve to impermissibly modify the substantive terms of the final order of divorce that had already divided up the marital estate.&#160; Indeed, the assignment she was seeking was from an employee retirement account that did not even exist at the time of their divorce.&#160; The&#160;<em>Nkopchieu&#160;</em>case, however, was different.&#160; Neither Rule 1.1 nor Virginia Code &#167; 20-107.3(K)(4) was implicated because the divorce case was still active, i.e., no final order had ever been entered. &#160;<em>Hoy</em>, therefore, was inapplicable.</p><p>The Virginia Court of Appeals thus was forced with determining whether this division was permissible under its state law.<a href="file:///C:/Users/nsolan.COOCHANDLAPHAM/Desktop/Blog%20Post%20-%20QDRO%20As%20Collections%20Tool%201.22.12.doc#&#95;ftn2">[2]</a>&#160; It essentially held that it had the power to assign the ex-husband&#8217;s employee retirement benefits because all of its past caselaw has made clear that the financial support of children is one of its most important concerns.<a href="file:///C:/Users/nsolan.COOCHANDLAPHAM/Desktop/Blog%20Post%20-%20QDRO%20As%20Collections%20Tool%201.22.12.doc#&#95;ftn3">[3]</a>&#160; It buttressed its decision by referencing Va.

aS'Teenage drivers, who suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, have a higher susceptibility to distractions while driving, and therefore have a higher risk of accidents. A study into teenage drivers and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is still in progress, but early findings seem to suggest that these teenagers may be at a higher risk of accidents because of the inability to filter out distractions.<br /><br />The studies are being conducted by a professor at the University of Buffalo, and the final results of the study are not expected be out for several years. However, Prof. Greg Fabiano has found enough to indicate that teen drivers with ADHD may be at a higher risk of accidents. His research is now focusing on how parents can encourage their children with ADHD to drive safely.<br /><br />The study is being funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, and involves two separate groups of teen drivers. The first group was exposed to additional driver education, and had monitoring devices fitted into their cars to monitor their driving behavior. The second group of teen motorists had additional driver education, the monitoring devices, and these drivers also signed contracts with their parents to reward good driving behaviors and punish bad driving behavior. <br /><br />Prof. Fabiano has already noticed some interesting things. Contrary to popular belief, teenagers actually like having monitoring devices in their cars, because these devices can help convince their parents that they are driving safely. Not surprising to <a href="http://www.lntlb.com/" title="Los Angeles Car Accident Attorney">Los Angeles car accident lawyers</a>, the study also shows that most teenagers believe that they can text while driving without any negative consequences. Besides, Fabiano is warning that texting while driving could prove especially hazardous to teen drivers with ADHD. These drivers already suffer from challenges with concentration and focusing, and the risks of an accident are amplified when you add cell phones to the equation.<br /><br /><!--more-->Teenage drivers, who suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \r\nDisorder, have a higher susceptibility to distractions while driving, \r\nand therefore have a higher risk of accidents.

This is a difficult time for the injured victim that has been burned, because not only is there the pain and suffering involved with the injury, but also the emotional trauma involved. \r\nSevere burn injuries are unlike other types of injuries, which can also play a role in the legal case, because these can be injuries that will mean being scarred for life, possibly not being able to continue with the same type of employment and that require ongoing surgeries for many years after the lawsuit is settled. </p><p>There are some claims that patients with burn injuries might obtain from this complex litigation that could involve a car accident caused by another driver, a defective product or a workplace injury that caused the injured victim to suffer and require burn injuries treatment and they can include:\r\nPayment for medical bills that have been incurred and future medical bills.\r\nCompensation for the loss of income since the accident that caused the burn injuries and in the future, due to the injuries.\r\n</p><p>Compensation for pain and suffering, the painful burn injuries treatment, disfigurement and ongoing management burn injuries require, such as cosmetic surgeries. \r\nThese are some of the items that will be listed in the victim with severe burn injuries legal claim and ones that are warranted, because just looking at burn injuries pictures it is easy to imagine the pain and suffering of the victim. </p><p>There are many concerns with the injured victim, like the burn injuries health of the victim, because these type of injuries are a high risk for infection and often require many surgeries to diminish the scarring as much as possible.

aS'<p>The first place to look to find the defining law for a criminal charge in Iowa is to the Iowa State Bar Association&#8217;s approved jury instructions. For (almost) every charge in Iowa, there exists a standard jury instruction which defines what elements the jury must determine have been met for a guilty verdict to occur.</p><p>And in searching these instructions for public intoxication you will find&#8230;nothing.</p><p>So what exactly does it take for a jury to find a defendant guilty of public intoxication? </p><p>The first myth to debunk is that a certain BAC on the portable breath test (PBT) will determine whether a person is intoxicated for purposes of the statute. The BAC limit for determining intoxication or being &#8220;under the influence&#8221; for an OWI is currently 0.08%. My other blog entries will inform you that the 0.08% for an OWI cannot be gathered from the PBT (it must be the police station&#8217;s large, non-portable machine), and also that you can still be guilty of OWI and blow under 0.08%. </p><p>But regarding public intoxication, the PBT is fair game for use in court, and there is no BAC cut off for guilty or not guilty. Someone could blow a 0.05% on the PBT and still be found guilty of public intoxication. Also, someone could blow above 0.08% and be found not guilty. There is no BAC bright line; the PBT is just another piece of evidence that would add to the officer&#8217;s observations.</p><p>Many times the Court will adopt the OWI &#8220;under the influence&#8221; jury instruction for a public intoxication trial. That jury instruction reads: </p><blockquote><p>Under The Influence. A person is &#8220;under the influence&#8221; when, by drinking liquor and/or beer, one or more of the following is true:</p><p>1. [His] [Her] reason or mental ability has been affected.</p><p>2. [His] [Her] judgment is impaired.</p><p>3. [His] [Her] emotions are visibly excited.</p><p>4. [He] [She] has, to any extent, lost control of bodily actions or motions.</p></blockquote><p>As you can see, this is a very liberal definition. A defendant can have his emotions &#8220;visibly excited&#8221; simply due to interaction with law enforcement. Nonetheless, this jury instruction is commonly used and has been endorsed (although not required) by Iowa appellate case law.</p><p>The Supreme Court of Iowa, however, has not officially ruled on what the public intoxication instruction should be. They have said what it is not, based on a few different lawyers&#8217; attempts to draft more conservatives instructions.</p><p>Obviously, the public has a greater interest in keeping &#8220;intoxicated&#8221; drivers off the street compared to keeping &#8220;intoxicated&#8221; persons off the sidewalks and out of the bars. Certainly an &#8220;intoxicated&#8221; person is less of a threat sitting at a booth at a bar, than behind the wheel of an automobile on a public street. Therefore, one could assume that these two persons would be held to different standards.</p><p>(And in case you were wondering, public intoxication can occur inside a bar.)</p><p>For the time being, there is no clear answer as to how they are treated. And until we get a clear jury instruction for the definition of public intoxication, the Court will continue to piggyback public intoxication instructions on the liberally-drawn OWI instructions.</p><p>This post was written by <a href="www.thompsonjustice.com">Iowa Criminal Lawyer</a> Mark Thompson, Attorney at Law.&#160; He can be reached at (319) 354-1630, or on his website at <a href="http://www.thompsonjustice.com/">www.thompsonjustice.com</a>.</p><!--more-->This article describes the current state of the public intoxication jury instruction for the State of Iowa.&#160; This post was authored by <a href="www.thompsonjustice.com">Iowa City Criminal Lawyer Mark Thompson.</a>&#160; He can be reached on his website at <a href="http://www.thompsonjustice.com/">www.thompsonjustice.com</a>.

aS'<p>Getting into a car accident can change your life. Car accidents are very serious and can result in major damage to your car as well as injuries that can affect you for the rest of your life, and end with tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills and a slow and painful recovery. However, there may be something that you can do to get your life back, When you have a debilitating vehicle injury you have to live with for the rest of your life, you should be compensated for it, by the person or party that caused the accident or their insurance.</p><p>One type of debilitating injury that can result from a car accident is full paralysis or partial paralysis. Paralysis is when a person is unable to move at least one and possibly more muscles.&#160; This may be a result of nerve damage or by an injury to the spinal cord. This can be an extremely debilitating injury and can change your life as you may have to use a wheel chair, and may not have use of your hands, legs or other parts of your body, possibly even those parts that are required to do your job, which you may have gone to school and spent years acquiring experience in.</p><p>Another possible injury when you have a car accident is a head injury that could result in brain damage. This can affect your speech, learning capabilities and possibly even your motor skills. A brain injury is a very serious type of debilitating injury and can reduce the quality of your life and even make you unable to work or to perform the tasks that you once loved doing, such as hobbies or spending time with your children. Head injuries are more rare in car accidents, because the brain is well protected inside the skull, but they do happen.</p><p>Another common result of a car accident is a back injury that can make you unable to work, or unable to work at the same job that you have experience in training in. This is particularly true if you have a back injury and your job was primarily physical, such as plumbing, construction or other types of hands-on jobs. Another possible result of a car accident is the fear of driving or the inability to drive at all. If you had a driving job such as a bus or taxi job this can mean the end of a great career and change your life considerably.</p><p>If you have suffered from debilitating injuries that were the result of someone else\'s carelessness or negligence, you should receive compensation for your injuries, the repairs needed on your car, and the quality of life that you have lost. An attorney that has experience with car accident cases and personal injury lawsuits can help you to collect money when your life is changed because of the negligence of another.

aS'Mindy was driving home from college to visit her parents when her car was struck by a drunk driver.  A blood sample revealed his blood alcohol level to be 0.32% wt./vol., nearly four (4) times higher than the legal limit.  He later pleaded guilty to multiple driving offenses, including Driving Under the Influence (&#8220;DUI&#8221;) and Reckless Endangerment with a Motor Vehicle.  All of this did little for Mindy, who suffered a multiple head injuries in the accident.  Adding insult to her injury was the fact that the drunk driver had no assets and little insurance coverage for the damages he caused.  Investigation revealed that the drunk driver had gone to a local bar twice that day, first to consume 5-6 beers, while there, and purchasing beer to go, which he took with him while he went fishing.  And then, later, on his way home, he stopped by to consume a minimum of twelve beers.  He was served this alcohol while he was visibly intoxicated.  At the accident scene, he did not suffer any injury.  However, he was staggering; he slurred his words; his eyes were glassy and he displayed other obvious signs of being drunk.<p>The bar that served the driver violated <a  rel="nofollow" title="Pennsylvania&#8217;s Dram Shop law" href="http://www.psp.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/hide&#95;removed&#95;legal/18298/hide&#95;pennsylvania&#95;liquor&#95;code&#95;-&#95;article&#95;iv&#95;(d)&#95;unlawful&#95;acts%3B&#95;penalties&#95;#sect493"><b><i>Pennsylvania&#8217;s Dram Shop law</i></b></a>, which uses the name &#8220;Dram&#8221; from England, where alcohol was sold by the &#8220;spoonful&#8221;, a &#8220;dram&#8221; unit of measure.

A wrongful \r\ndeath lawsuit may also be filed against parties other than the victim&#8217;s \r\nemployer. Entities that may face such third-party liability lawsuits \r\ninclude subcontractors or equipment manufacturers.</p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that OSHA&#8217;s investigation and any subsequent \r\nfines levied as a result, are separate from any civil litigation family \r\nmembers may bring in the event of a wrongful death in the workplace. \r\nStill, OSHA&#8217;s findings may be an important part of that civil case \r\nbecause you have an unbiased government agency uncovering multiple \r\nsafety violations just before a fatal incident. Even if those violations\r\n didn&#8217;t directly contribute to the death, their presence establishes a \r\npattern of negligence with regard to worker safety.</p>\r\n<p>According to <a target="&#95;blank" href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/bridge-builders-face-fines-over-worker-s-death/article&#95;9432655b-18fe-5e23-840f-eb5092580d48.html">The St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a>,\r\n the 35-year-old carpenter was employed by a company that was working on\r\n a piece of equipment called an aerial man lift. That lift is similar to\r\n a cherry picker, and it&#8217;s typically used to lift a person up to a crane\r\n so he or she can disconnect or connect certain construction materials.</p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s believed he was operating the machine when it tipped over while he was still in the bucket.</p>\r\n<p>According to OSHA&#8217;s citation, the lift had been positioned on a barge\r\n that was regularly used by employees without following the \r\nmanufacturer&#8217;s safety requirements. The manual specifically cautions \r\nagainst using it on a mobile surface or vehicle.</p>\r\n<p>Employers have a responsibility to ensure that their workers are \r\nfollowing safety protocol. That does not appear to have happened in this\r\n case.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to this violation, OSHA cited several more. Investigators\r\n say the construction company had no outlined safety practices or \r\nprocedures for pipe piling installations. There was also reportedly a \r\nfailure on the part of the company to protect employees who were \r\ninstalling those pilings, and workers weren&#8217;t properly trained on how to\r\n safely operate the man lift.</p>\r\n<p>The work was being done as part of a nearly $650 million project to \r\nrealign and reconstruct Interstate 70, as well as several local roads on\r\n both the Illinois an Missouri sides of the river.

aS'<p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">There are many kinds of entities. Partnerships, corporations and limited liability companies (LLC) are the most common. There are also limited partnerships (LP), limited liability partnerships (LLP, and limited liability limited partnerships (LLLP). Let&#8217;s start with the common and work up to more the complex.</p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">But before doing that consider this: is an individual engaged in business on his or her own an entity? Not yet. Lawyers call that person a sole proprietor. Generally, a sole proprietor is liable for contracts entered into and for negligence and other torts commited by the business and employees. So, it&#8217;s a not a very sophisticated way to engage in business. But, it&#8217;s easy to form a sole proprietorship because it&#8217;s automatic when a natural person (a legal term for people) starts his or her own business.</p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">A partnership is generally formed when two or more persons engage in business to share profits and losses. This is a general partnership. The persons can be individuals or entities such as corporations or other partnerships. Like a sole proprietorship, partners are usually liable for the contract debts of the partnership. Also, it&#8217;s easy to form a partnership because it&#8217;s automatic when two persons go into business and share profits and losses and do not form a corporation, LLC or other type of entity. Even if there is no written partnership agreement. Of course, it&#8217;s best to have a written partnership agreement, and they are often complicated to draft because there are so many optional provisions that can be included. </p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">Some states allow or require partnerships to file a partnership registration statement with the state secretary of state or other filing office. Such states often maintain online databases of public records information about partnerships that file annual returns and registration statements. This information might include names of partners, addresses, and sometimes copies of documents.</p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">Florida allows a partnership to file a statement of qualification to elect to have limited liability, so that it then becomes a limited liability partnership or LLP.</p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">A limited partnership is similar to a general partnership but it has two types of partners: general partners and limited partners. The general partners have liability for contract debts of the limited partnership, but the limited partners do not (if the limited partnership and partners comply with the limited partnership law). The limited partnership is usually formed by filing a certificate of limited partnership with the state secretary of state or other filing office. Florida&#160;allows a limited partnership to elect limited liability for its general partner by filing a statement of qualification with the state, thus becoming a limited liability limited partnership or LLLP.</p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">Partnerships, limited partnerships, LLPs and LLLPs are burdened with complex income tax codes and accounting methods that often challenge intuition. For that reason, many lawyers and accountants still advise clients to form corporations for their businesses instead of partnerships or limited liability companies (LLC&#8217;s usually elect to be taxed the same as partnerships).</p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">A corporation is an entity generally formed by one or more persons filing articles of incorporation with the state secretary of state or other filing office. Most states maintain online databases of public records information about corporations that file annual reports, articles of incorporation, mergers, name changes, and other forms. This information might include names and addresses of officers, directors and registered agents, as well as copies of documents. This information often includes names of presidents, vice presidents, secretaries, treasurers and other officers of corporations.</p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">S corporations are corporations that have filed a form with IRS to elect to be treated as such for tax purposes.</p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">Public corporations are corporations whose shares of stock are held by many people such that they are subject to the Securities Exchange Act. Privately (closely) held corporations are the typical corporations of businesses whose stock is not traded publicly. </p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">Of course, it is likely that the ownership interests in all corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies and other entities are securities that are subject to the federal and state securities laws.</p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21"><p>Nonprofit corporations are generally formed by three or more persons filing articles of incorporation with the state secretary of state or other filing office. Some states have various categories of nonprofit corporations, such as religious, charitable, benevolent, etc. If the nonprofit corporation requires tax exemption, a separate application for recognition of tax exempt status must be filed with IRS. This makes nonprofit corporations frequently more complicated to form than for profit business corporations. Nonprofit corporations usually appear in state online databases of corporate information.</p><p>A limited liability company (LLC) has characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership.&#160; It is formed by filing articles of organizations with the Florida Secretary of State, but it has members instead of shareholders, directors and officers.&#160; It can elect to be taxed as a partnership.</p></p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">There are other types of entities, such as business trusts, real estate investment trusts, but they are less common and are usually created by special purpose statutes for specific types of business, government or quasi-government functions. They often do not appear in state online databases of public records information due to their unusual nature.</p><p WIDTH: 566px" class="style21">By the way, this is not legal advice. This is a general background discussion of the types of entities in the US. The specifics vary from state to state because entities are generally created under state law, and each state has its own law, so there are 50 sets of entities laws in the US.</p><!--more-->Corporations, partnerships and LLCs are the common entities to choose from in Florida.'

aS'32 year old Kenneth Sullivan had custody of his young daughter through divorce proceedings. &#160;In a later modification, it was proved that Kenneth was having a sexual affair with a 19 year old and had actually snuck into the 19 year old&#8217;s parent&#8217;s home at night to have sex with her. &#160;Kenneth also admitted to drinking and driving, but denied doing it with his daughter in the car. &#160;The daughter, however, told the Guardian Ad Litem that Kenneth did, in fact, drink while driving her in the car. It was also established that Kenneth had friends who used crystal meth. &#160;The trial court was &#8220;troubled&#8221; by Kenneth&#8217;s drinking and driving and immoral behavior, but concluded that since there was no proof this behavior had an adverse impact on the daughter, no change in custody was warranted under our law.<br color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Trebuchet MS\', Trebuchet, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; background-color: rgb(220, 212, 203); " /><br color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Trebuchet MS\', Trebuchet, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; background-color: rgb(220, 212, 203); " />This was a correct reasoning on the part of the trial judge according to the Court of Appeals. &#160;<a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ms-court-of-appeals/1601813.html?utm&#95;source=feedburner&utm&#95;medium=feed&utm&#95;campaign=Feed%3A+FindLawMissCtApp+(FindLaw+Case+Law+Updates+-+MS+Court+of+Appeals)" target="&#95;blank" text-decoration: none; color: rgb(84, 115, 192); font-family: \'Trebuchet MS\', Trebuchet, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; background-color: rgb(220, 212, 203); "><i>Sullivan v. Sullivan</i>, No. 2010-CA-01847-COA</a>&#160;(Decided May 29, 2012.) &#160;The Court concluded that no change was warranted because the four year old daughter had not exhibited any harm from this conduct. &#160;The question is: Should our law require that a court wait for damage to a child before acting in its best interests? Should a court be required to wait for a child to be injured in a car wreck before it acts in its best interests on drinking and driving? Should the court wait until the child is 16 and pregnant before it acts to protect it from immoral upbringing?'

We want to make sure that our food, our children&#8217;s toys, and our\r\ncommunities are safe. On an individual level, inline skaters wear pads on their\r\nelbows and knees; motorcycle riders wear helmets. They don&#8217;t plan to fall, but\r\nthey know it could happen, so they prepare for the worst before they begin.\r\nSimilarly, good drivers put on their seatbelts when they get into the car; some\r\ncars are even equipped with automatic seatbelts, designed to keep us as safe as\r\npossible. With all this emphasis on safety, why aren&#8217;t more people preparing\r\nprenuptial agreements before they get married? </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Prenuptial agreements (also called &#8220;prenups&#8221;) get a bad rap.\r\nThey&#8217;re seen as mood-killers, the death of romance, proof of a lack of trust.\r\nAsking your future spouse to make a prenup with you seems tantamount to\r\nadmitting defeat before you even begin. You&#8217;d like to believe that you&#8217;ll always\r\nbe able to resolve your differences in a reasonable way, without ever losing\r\nsight of your love for each other. You won&#8217;t argue about silly things, and\r\nyou&#8217;ll certainly never get divorced. After all, this is true love - right? </p><p class="MsoNormal">The truth is, people break up sometimes. It happens. Nobody\r\nplans it, but it happens anyway. And when it does happen, well, most people\r\naren&#8217;t at their best during a divorce. Think about it: have you ever been\r\nthrough a breakup? Were you and your former partner both at your most\r\nreasonable and considerate at the time? Really?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">For most of us, the end of a romantic relationship tends to\r\nmake us, well, a little cranky. It&#8217;s not the ideal state of mind for making\r\nimportant decisions. The best time, actually, is before you even walk down the\r\naisle. You&#8217;re planning your future together, reveling in the knowledge that\r\nyou&#8217;ll be spending the rest of your lives with each other - this is the time to\r\nensure that you and your future mate can communicate with each other about the\r\ndifficult things: how to handle debt (existing and future), who will be\r\nresponsible for ongoing household bills, and even how to settle any serious\r\ndisagreements in future.&#160; </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">California law requires you and your partner to have separate attorneys when you&#160; make a prenuptial\r\nagreement. You can draft the document yourself (Nolo Press makes a terrific\r\nbook on the subject) and take it to your lawyers for review. That way, you&#8217;ll\r\nlearn what your legal rights really are, so that you and your partner can\r\nexecute an agreement that&#8217;s fair, reasonable, and legal.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Making a prenuptial agreement doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll get\r\ndivorced, anymore than wearing your seatbelt means you&#8217;ll have a car accident.\r\nWhat it does mean is that you&#8217;re prepared; if something terrible happens, you\r\nwon&#8217;t be hurt as badly. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Traditionally, more people may get married at this time of year than any other time.&#160; So when that special someone &#8220;pops the\r\nquestion&#8221; of marriage, pop one of your own: &#8220;will you sign a prenuptial\r\nagreement?&#8221;</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Comments?

aS'<a href="http://www.fagellaw.com/Information&#95;Center/Cerebral&#95;Palsy.aspx" title="Cerebral palsy">Cerebral palsy</a> is a neurological disorder caused by damage to the brain before, during, or after birth.&#160; Even though the symptoms of cerebral palsy involve motor coordination problems and affects muscle movement, it is not a disorder caused by damage to the muscles or nerves, but rather by damage to the motor areas of the brain that prevent the brain from properly controlling movement and posture. <br /><br />The majority of children with cerebral palsy are born with the disorder.&#160; Cerebral palsy is not a progressive disorder, meaning it does not worsen over time.&#160; At this time there is no cure for cerebral palsy. <br /><br />Depending on the part of the brain that has been affected, there are a range of symptoms and the severity can range from mild to severe.&#160; Symptoms may include lack of muscle coordination, problems learning, moving, crawling, sitting, walking, talking, seeing, hearing, seizures, developmental disabilities, swallowing, and eating.&#160; Children with cerebral palsy may also have muscle paralysis that can affect the arms or legs. <br /><br />It&#8217;s important to understand that the signs of cerebral palsy may not present themselves immediately after birth, but may take several years to become apparent.&#160; This creates a difficult challenge for parents, especially if the cerebral palsy was the result of medical malpractice, as the statute of limitations places time limits on how long a family may wait to file a lawsuit.&#160; Therefore, if the family suspects the child may have cerebral palsy, they should see a doctor right away.&#160; If is determined the child has cerebral palsy, the family should contact a cerebral palsy lawyer right away.&#160; There are tests a doctor can perform to see if cerebral palsy exists, including a CT scan, neurological examination, EEG, MRI, vision test, hearing test, and blood tests.<br /><br />What are the causes of cerebral palsy<a href="http://www.cerebralpalsydoctorlawyer.com/Cerebral&#95;Palsy/Causes&#95;of&#95;Cerebral&#95;Palsy.aspx"></a>?<br /><br />Cerebral palsy may be caused by many factors including those which may be unknown.&#160; Cerebral palsy may result from a lack of oxygen flow to the brain of the baby, premature delivery, delivery mistakes, severe jaundice that is not treated promptly, brain trauma, and specific infections with the mother including meningitis. &#160;<br /><br />Because cerebral palsy can have a lifetime of consequences for both the child and the family, any case involving a baby with cerebral palsy needs a careful investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the labor and delivery to find out if this disorder could have been prevented.&#160; In many cases, evidence in the medical records, including the fetal monitor strip will show significant problems during labor that should have resulted in an immediate response by the medical personnel, including a possible earlier delivery.<br /><br />If your child has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, medical malpractice may be the cause.&#160; You should contact California cerebral palsy lawyer Dr. Bruce Fagel right away for a free consultation at (800) 541-9376.&#160; Dr. Fagel is a medical malpractice attorney and a licensed medical doctor.&#160; <br /><br />Visit us on Facebook and Twitter:<br /> Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/birthinjury" title="Facebook">https://www.facebook.com/birthinjury</a><br /> Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/fagellaw" title="Twitter">https://twitter.com/fagellaw</a><br /><br /><!--more-->Cerebral palsy is a neurological disorder caused by damage to the brain before, during, or after birth.&#160; If is determined a child\'s cerebral palsy was caused by medical malpractice, the family should contact a cerebral palsy lawyer right away.'

aS'<p><strong>THE 200 FOOT RULE</strong></p><p>The <strong>Alcoholic Beverage Control Law</strong> prohibits certain licenses from being issued if the location of the establishment is on the same street and within 200 feet of a building that is used exclusively as a school, church, synagogue or other place of worship. This restriction is commonly called the <a href="http://www.abc.state.ny.us/system/files/200-500ft-rule.pdf">200 foot rule</a> and applies to any retail establishment where liquor will be sold for on premises consumption and any retail establishment where liquor or wine will be sold for consumption off the premises.</p><p>Measurement of distance The law provides that the measurement be taken in a straight line from the center of the nearest entrance of the school/place of worship to the center of the nearest entrance of the establishment. The distance is determined using only entrances that are regularly used to give ingress to (a) the students of the school, (b) the general public into the place of worship; and (c) patrons into the establishment. Emergency/fire exits, maintenance access, and doors to gain access to non-public areas are not used in the measurement. If the entrance is set back from the sidewalk by a walkway or doorway, the measurement is taken from the center of the line where the walkway/doorway meets the sidewalk. For an establishment in a multi-story building, the building entrance at street level is used.</p><p><strong>CORNER LOCATIONS</strong></p><p>The statute refers to the school/place of worship being on the same street as the licensed premises. The buildings do not have to be on the same block. With respect to an establishment or school/place of worship on a corner lot, the building is considered to be on both streets, whether or not there is an entrance to the building on both streets.</p><p><strong>EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE &quot;GRANDFATHER&quot; CLAUSE</strong></p><p>If the 200 foot rule applies to a particular location, the Authority does not have the discretion to grant the application. Even if the school/place of worship consents to the issuance of the license, the Authority cannot approve the application. If the Authority discovers that an establishment has been licensed in violation of the rule, it cannot allow the violation to continue when the license comes up for renewal. The statute does, however, provide for certain exceptions to the rule:</p><ul><li>&#160;Establishments in operation since December 5, 1933 (the end of prohibition);</li><li>If the location was licensed before the school/place of worship existed, the Authority can renew the license and approve applications to transfer ownership</li><li>If a hotel has an existing &quot;RL&quot; [restaurant liquor] license, it may obtain a &quot;HL&quot; [hotel liquor] license;</li><li>Applications for a &quot;CL&quot; [club liquor] when the club is affiliated with the school/place of worship; </li><li>Legitimate theater operated by a not-for-profit organization; and</li><li>The -Authority may permit the licensee to move a licensed premises that has an exception to another location within 200 feet of the school/church, as long as the new location is not closer than the old location.</li></ul><p><strong>EXCLUSIVE USE AS SCHOOL/PLACE OF WORSHIP</strong></p><p>While the law uses the phrase &quot;building used exclusively&quot; as a school/place of worship, the courts have adopted a test that looks to whether the building is used primarily as a school/place of worship. The building will still be considered a school/place of worship as long as any use is incidental to, and are not inconsistent with or detracting from the predominant character of the building as a school/place of worship.</p><p>In 2007, the 200 foot rule was amended to clarify that the use of a building for certain purposes would be considered incidental to its primary use as a place of worship. Those uses include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>The conduct of legally authorized games of bingo or other games of chance held as a means of raising funds for the not-for-profit religious organization which conducts services at the place of worship or for other not-for-profit organizations or groups;</li><li>Use of the building for fund-raising performances by or benefitting the not-for-profit religious organization which conducts services at the place of worship or other not-for-profit organizations or groups;</li><li>The use of the building by other religious organizations or groups for religious services or other purposes;the conduct of social activities by or for the benefit of the congregants;</li><li>The use of the building for meetings held by organizations or groups providing bereavement counseling to persons having suffered the loss of a loved one, or providing advice or support for conditions or diseases including, but not limited to, alcoholism, drug addiction, cancer, cerebral palsy, Parkinson\'s disease, or Alzheimer\'s disease;</li><li>The use of the building for blood drives, health screenings, health information meetings, yoga classes, exercise classes or other activities intended to promote the health of the congregants or other persons;</li><li>And use of the building by non-congregant members of the community for private social functions. </li></ul><p>In addition, the amendment also provided that a building would still be considered as &quot;used exclusively&quot; as a place of worship even when the not-for-profit religious organization occupying the place of worship accepts payments from those using the building to assist in defraying costs related to that party\'s use of the building.</p><p><a href="http://www.stacyweisslaw.com/" target="&#95;blank">New York City&#160;ABC dispute lawyer</a>,&#160;Stacy Weiss&#160;gives personalized attention to clients with expertise in the areas of <strong>Liquor Licensing and Alcoholic Beverage Control Law</strong> for all counties in New York State.

aS'<p>You must take many issues into consideration when filing for divorce in Santa Barbara.&#160; The first thing you should do is consult an attorney who specializes in matrimonial law.&#160; An experienced family law attorney can explain the different types of divorce proceedings and help determine what is right for you.&#160; Once you understand all of your options, your attorney helps you through the process and ensures that your divorce resolves in a satisfactory and equitable agreement.&#160; </p><p><strong>Types of divorce processes </strong>A variety of divorce processes are available to you when you are divorcing in Santa Barbara: </p><ul><li>Separation.&#160; A legal separation is not the same as a divorce.&#160; In a separation, you will agree on terms for division of property and child custody, but the marriage is not legally dissolved and the parties may not remarry.</li><li>Mediation.&#160; Divorce mediation is a process by which the divorcing parties reach an agreement outside of court in a series of meetings facilitated by a neutral mediator.&#160; Mediation gives the parties the opportunity to work out the terms of their divorce on their own instead of being bound by the ruling of the court.</li><li>Collaborative divorce.&#160; Like mediation, collaborative divorce is an alternative to a court proceeding.&#160; In a collaborative divorce, the parties and their attorneys work together to reach an equitable settlement that is in the best interests of everyone involved.&#160; Collaborative divorce emphasizes communication and often incorporates the input of experts such as financial consultants and child specialists.&#160; If you pursue a collaborative divorce, it is best to have an attorney who is specially trained in collaborative family law.</li><li>Litigation.&#160; In cases where a divorce is contested and the parties cannot reach an agreement on their own, the divorce will ultimately be resolved in a courtroom.&#160; In litigation, the judge decrees the final divorce agreement and outlines all the terms, including child support, spousal support, and division of property.</li></ul><p>An experienced family law attorney can tell you more about the different types of divorce proceedings and will help you determine what is the most appropriate course of action based on your situation.</p><p><strong>Contact a Santa Barbara divorce attorney</strong>Finding the right family law and estate planning attorney is not always easy, but it is important.

aS'<p><u>SEX OFFENSES</u>&#160; </p><p>The penalty or punishment for&#160;sex crimes such as Child Molestatation, Sexual Assault, Sexual Battery, Prostitution or Lewd Conduct can vary greatly in different parts of California.&#160; Some counties have special &quot;Sex Crime Units&quot; within the office of the District Attorney.&#160; These specially assigned prosecutors are usually very experienced and have had special training, as a result, these prosecutors are very aggressive in the prosecution of sex offenses.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p /><p>A sex crime charged as a misdemeanor, such as misdemeanor Sexual Battery,&#160;Prostitution or Lewd Conduct can result in jail time up to one year in a county jail.&#160; However, felony sex offenses such as Child Molestatation, Sexual Assault&#160;and Rape can require registration&#160;as a sex offender (see more information on Megan\'s Law below), years of formal probation, jail time or a state prison sentence,&#160;fines, psychiatric&#160;counseling, AIDS education and testing, community service, and extensive news media coverage of the conviction.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Even though there is an increased awareness of false accusations, such as in false accusations made in &quot;high profile&quot; divorce cases, sex crimes are some of the most vigorously prosecuted and severely punished offenses in the criminal justice system. It is a shock being falsely accused of a crime. For example, those falsely accused of child sexual abuse often find the allegations to be absurd and frequently act in ways that later create problems. </p><p /><p>If you have been charged with a sex crime law violation, whether you feel you may be guilty or not, then you need experienced legal counsel. If you are convicted you may face long term incarceration in a county jail or state prison and required registration as a sex offender for the rest of your life. </p><p /><p>An experienced sex crime lawyer will confidentially yet aggressively defend you and ensure that your constitutional rights are protected.

They vary in type and by severity of prosecution and punishment. Many of the commonly known crimes that fall into this category are Rape (including Statutory Rape, Spousal Rape and Date Rape), Child Molestation, Sexual Battery, Lewd Conduct, Possession and Distribution of Child Pornography (including on the internet), Possession and Distribution of Obscene Material, Prostitution, Solicitation of Prostitution, Pimping, Pandering, Indecent Exposure, Lewd Act with a Child, and Penetration of the Genital or Anal Region by a Foreign Object. </p><p><a name="#3">Should I talk to the police if I am under investigation for a sex a crime?</a></p><p>No, you should not talk to the police without having a sex crime lawyer present. Anything you say can and will be used against you. More importantly, what you say may be misconstrued or misinterpreted and used as evidence for your prosecution. </p><p><a name="#4">Can a sex crime conviction be removed from my record?</a></p><p>No, a conviction can never truly be wiped off your record in most cases, but in some situations it can be &quot;expunged&quot;. An expungement can result in your conviction being dismissed and/or having your guilty plea set aside. This can aid greatly in getting a persons life back on track. In some cases even more can be done for a person with a conviction. An experienced sex crime attorney can be the difference in moving past a prior conviction for a sex crime. </p><p><a name="#5">What does registered sex offender mean, and what is Megan\'s law?</a></p><p>For over 50 years California has required dangerous sex offenders to register with their local law enforcement agencies. However this information was not available to the public until implementation of Megan\'s Law in 1996. Megan\'s Law is named after 7-year-old Megan Kanka who was raped and murdered by a known child molester who had moved in across the street without her parent\'s knowledge. In the wake of the tragedy there was a wide spread movement that resulted in legislation requiring law enforcement to notify and provide warning to local communities about dangerous sex offenders in the area. A person required to register yearly as a sex offender will do so for the rest of their lives. The sex offenders name will be available to the public and they will have to report their location to law enforcement every time they move. Not all sex crimes require registration, but many do. If you are charged with a sex crime ask our sex crime lawyers if a conviction will require registration. </p><p><a name="#6">How can I be charged with rape when the victim consented to sex?</a></p><p>There are certain situations where persons can not legally consent to having sex. Consent to sex can never be given by minors, mentally disabled persons, and physically incapacitated persons (intoxicated, asleep, unconscious, ill, or drugged) as a matter of law. This comes to play in cases of statutory rape (adult with a minor) or in cases of date rape where drugs such as rohypnol, &quot;roofies&quot; or alcohol are used. Voluntary intoxication by the victim is not a defense to crimes such as sexual assault. Voluntary intoxication by the perpetrator is also not a defense.</p><p><a name="#7">What if the victim in a statutory rape case lied about their age, and I honestly did not know they were under 18?</a></p><p>Statutory rape is a strict liability offense. A person can be found guilty of the crime even if they honestly believed the other person was 18 or older. They can also be found guilty of the crime even if the victim consented and gave false information regarding their age.</p><p><a name="#8">In a solicitation of prostitution case, is it entrapment if the female police officer approached me and asked if I wanted to have sex?</a></p><p>In most cases, no. Police officers are allowed to do many things in prostitution cases that do not result in entrapment, including offering sexual services. The key is what you did to acknowledge that you wanted to engage in a sex for money transaction. This can include verbal or non-verbal communication. Was there an act in furtherance, such as taking out money, going to an ATM machine or taking the officer to a motel. An examination of what &quot;exactly&quot; happened is extremely important in these cases. Please contact our firm immediately if you have been arrested for solicitation.</p><p><a name="#9">Can I be prosecuted for looking at pornography on the internet?</a></p><p>Internet sex crimes are now vigorously prosecuted. Downloading child pornography or obscene material can result in prosecution by state and federal authorities. In some cases individuals who have simply visited internet sites displaying illegal content have faced scrutiny and prosecution.</p><p><a name="#10">What are the defenses to a sex crime?</a></p><p>Generally the defenses include insufficient or tainted evidence, factual innocence (mistaken identity), and in some cases consent.</p><p><a name="#11">What can I do to improve my chances? </a></p><p>Retain qualified and experienced counsel as soon as possible. Please call our firm at 1-866-388-7663. Do not share with others the details of the incident. Exercise your right to remain silent. Write down significant events, potential witnesses and alibis. Don\'t try to handle things yourself. Gather documentation of your good character (reference letters, employment history etc.). </p><p><a name="#12">What will your firm do for me?</a></p><p>Our firm has over 60 years of criminal prosecution, investigation, judicial and defense trial experience. We have handled many &quot;high profile&quot; felony cases in a discrete manner. We will provide a shield for you and yet strongly advocate for your defense. We will provide early preparation, including legal research and defense identification. We will investigate and identify all facts helpful to your defense.

aS'<p class="MsoNormal">\r\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, the trucking industry employs more than three million truck drivers each year. Because the majority of commercial truck drivers cross state lines, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), which is a branch of the U.S. Department of Transportation, is responsible for establishing and enforcing truck driver regulations. The FMCSA was established in 2000 to prevent commercial vehicle related fatalities and injuries. Before 2000, when the FMCSA was established, truck driver regulations varied from state to state. Due to the inconsistency of truck driver training and regulations, a large number of preventable commercial truck accident injuries and deaths occurred. </p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Commercial Driver&#8217;s License</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">Any person who operates a vehicle weighing 26,000 pounds or more must hold a commercial driver&#8217;s license (CDL). To obtain a CDL, individuals must pass a written test and a driving skills test in which they must perform a set of required driving maneuvers. The FMCSA requires all CDL applicants to be at least 21 years of age.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Physical Examination</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">The FMCSA requires all truck drivers to pass a physical examination conducted by a licensed medical examiner every two years. During an examination, a truck driver&#8217;s hearing, vision and blood pressure will be checked. The mental health history of the driver will also be reviewed. Truck drivers cannot suffer from epilepsy, heart conditions, vision or hearing issues, alcohol or substance abuse, diabetes or any type of condition that limits their mobility. Truck drivers who do not pass a physical examination are not allowed to operate a commercial truck.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Hours-of-Service</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">To ensure truck drivers are getting the necessary rest to properly perform their job, the FMCSA established regulations on how long a truck driver could drive. Truck drivers who carry cargo may drive a maximum of 11 hours after ten consecutive hours off duty. Truckers who carry passengers may drive a maximum of ten hours after eight consecutive hours off duty. Failure to comply with the FMCSAs Hours-of-Service (HOS) can result in the loss of a CDL.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Experience Matters</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, because many truck drivers do not comply with regulations, thousands of innocent motorists are still being injured or killed in truck accidents every year in the U.S. If you have been injured or have lost a loved one in a truck collision, a knowledgeable <a href="http://www.sacramento-personalinjurylawyers.com/truck-accident.html">Sacramento truck accident attorney</a> can assist you with the claims process.

aS'<div DISPLAY: block" id="previewbody">The <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/index.htm">Family &amp; Medical Leave Act</a> provides protection for covered employees to take up to 12 weeks of leave under three specific conditions:<br /><blockquote>-for the birth and care of the newborn child of the employee;<br />-for placement<br />with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care;<br />-to care<br />for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious -health<br />condition; or<br />-to take medical leave when the employee is unable to work<br />because of a serious health condition. </blockquote>However, does this <em>always</em> mean an employer must return an employee <em>and </em>return them to the same or equivalent position? The answer is no, but only in very limited exceptions. Also, there are lots of arguments over what is an &quot;equivalent position.&quot; However, the guidelines for &quot;equivalent position&quot; are very specific and somewhat obvious.<br /><br /><strong><u>Exceptions for Employers NOT to Reinstate Employee on FMLA Leave</u></strong><br /><br />As stated before, taking FMLA leave does not always require an employer to reinstate an employee upon attempted return but only in limited circumstances. Those circumstances/exceptions are:<br /><br />1) When employee is laid off due to economic reasons or the employee\'s shift is eliminated.<br />2) Employee was hired for specific project and that project is complete.<br />3) When employee can no longer perform &quot;essential functions&quot; of job. May be obligations under Americans with Disabilities Act, however.<br />4) A &quot;key employee&quot; need not be reinstated. Key employees are amongst the highest paid with the employer. The employer has to show that it would suffer a substantial economic loss to operations. This exception is very complicated and beyond the scope of this overview article.</div>'

When you need a personal injury lawyer, you should engage the service of one who is good in terms of experience in the field, qualifications, reliability, and character. There are certain strategies that you can utilise to find yourself a great personal injury lawyer.</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>&#160;</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal">The search for a great personal injury lawyer requires a certain amount of effort on your part.&#160; Most importantly, you will need to do some research before you start seeking for a legal professional to handle your personal injury case. You should research thoroughly about the professional background of the lawyer or lawyers whom you are interested in approaching. This way, you will know that you will be in the hands of a qualified lawyer, and you can be more comfortable to reach a final decision.</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>&#160;</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal">Besides, each field of legal representation varies from one to another and each requires specific knowledge. Hence, you will need to find a personal injury lawyer that has ample experience in handling your type of case, so that the legal process will be smoother and more successful. For example, car accident lawyer for auto accident cases, burn injury lawyer for fires, etc.</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>&#160;</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal">You can easily obtain information regarding different lawyers through the Internet. There may be testimonials posted by existing clients regarding the services rendered by the legal representative. Hence, you can get a general idea about how the lawyer in question is like, in terms of service and character. With this knowledge, you are more likely to be able to make a better choice.</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>&#160;</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal">To find out more about the reputation of your prospective lawyer within the legal community of your area, you can also try checking with the local legal agencies. You will be more comfortable engaging the services of the personal injury lawyer if he or she has a good reputation amongst their peers. It also helps to ask for professional references from the attorney prior to making any decision. This is because it is important for a good personal injury lawyer to have multiple positive references as well as good reputation, so that satisfactory settlements can be achieved.</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>&#160;</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal">The charges of the lawyer should also be taken into consideration. It is better to find out the charges, to avoid facing exorbitant charges after you have signed a contract.</p><p /><p /><p>Ledger&#160;Law Firm<br />811 Wilshire Blvd<br />Suite 1000<br />Los Angeles, CA 90017<br />Office: 213-493-6588<br />Toll Free 800-300-0001<br />Website: <a href="http://www.ledgerlaw.com/">www.ledgerlaw.com</a></p><p /></div>'

Talk to the attorney in person.&#160; If you are shuffled off to a secretary or clerk, the attorney does not have the time needed to devote to your case.&#160; You should expect to speak to the lawyer in person, and have any questions answered promptly.<br />2. Don\'t be afraid to ask questions.&#160; You are not expected to know all the details of the legal system; that is what your Huntington Beach personal injury lawyer is for.&#160; If you do not understand something, ask questions; a good personal injury attorney will never be upset with you for wanting to know about the details of your case.&#160; As you interview potential lawyers, listen carefully to how they respond to your questions.&#160; This is a good indication of the type of relationship you will be developing with your attorney.<br />3. Understand fee agreements.&#160; Fee agreements are legal documents signed by both you and the attorney, and they explain exactly what you will be paying for the attorney&#8217;s services.&#160; It is vital that you understand the fee agreement prior to signing, and that you are comfortable with its contents.<br />4. Hire a lawyer with whom you feel comfortable.&#160; Your lawyer is your agent, your friend, your counselor, and the person who is going to go to bat for you to recover damages from your injury.&#160; It is vital that you have a good working relationship with your Huntington Beach personal injury lawyer, and if you don&#8217;t, you will not be able to help with the process of your case.&#160; Your input is important, and your lawyer should value your time and efforts to help.<br />5. Provide information promptly. If your lawyer asks you to provide documents or facts, be sure to return calls promptly and provide needed information in a timely manner.&#160; Many personal injury cases are sidetracked waiting on the plaintiff&#8212;that is you---to provide necessary information.&#160; Work with your lawyer, not against.<br />6. Be honest and reasonable.&#160; Do not try to gloss over or add facts to your case; this only causes problems as the lawsuit progresses.&#160; You should also be reasonable about your expectations from the case.&#160; Although we have all read of multi-million dollar settlements for very minor injuries, the fact is that those cases are the exception, not the norm.&#160; Listen to your Huntington Beach personal injury attorney and what he or she has to say about the value of your case.<br /><br />Hiring a <a href="http://www.orange-county-lawyers.com/huntington-beach-personal-injury-lawyers.html" title="huntington beach personal injury attorneys">Huntington Beach personal injury attorney</a> is a process a bit like forming any other relationship.&#160; Find someone you like and are comfortable with, and do your part to make the relationship work.&#160; Your reward will be a good and fair settlement for your injuries.<!--more-->If you are in need of skilled Huntington Beach personal injury lawyers,\r\n but are not sure exactly how to go about finding one, we are here to \r\nhelp you.&#160; These tips will help you choose the right personal injury \r\nattorney for your case, and allow you to rest, relax, and recover while \r\nyour lawyer handles the recovery of your damages.'

aS'An on-going problem facing all employers is the\r\nmisclassification of employees as independent contractors. &#160;The IRS is\r\nextremely interested in the misclassification of employees because it results\r\nin the failure to pay employment taxes. &#160;Taxpayers are concerned because\r\nthe trust fund portion of the amount withheld from an employee&#8217;s compensation\r\nis a personal liability of the officer of the corporation, a liability which\r\ncannot be discharged in bankruptcy. &#160;If you or a client faces such\r\nliability, speak to an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/GivnerandKaye#p/u/11/w3jLaxn277E" target="&#95;blank" title="Givner & Kaye">expert asset protection</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/GivnerandKaye#p/u/13/bkH1Kjl2yPc" target="&#95;blank" title="Givner & Kaye">tax attorney</a>. On September 19, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service signed\r\na memorandum of understanding with the Department of Labor agreeing to share\r\ninformation and other materials in its efforts to reduce the misclassification\r\nof employees as independent contractors. &#8220;We know we can\'t stop misclassification on our own,&#8221;\r\nLabor Secretary Hilda Solis said. &#8220;By joining forces, we\'ll be more able to\r\nstrategically educate employers and enhance compliance.&#8221; The agreement comes as a part of the Labor Department\'s\r\nMisclassification Initiative that was launched under Vice President Joe Biden\'s\r\nMiddle Class Task Force to prevent, detect, and remedy the misclassification of\r\nemployees. DOL\'s Wage and Hour Division, IRS, and agency leaders from\r\nConnecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Utah, and Washington\r\nsigned memoranda of understanding to work together to combat the practice by\r\nwhich some employers incorrectly classify their workers as independent\r\ncontractors rather than as employees to avoid paying payroll taxes and workers\'\r\ncompensation expenses. IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman addressed early press\r\nreports that the move signaled IRS\'s intent to launch new investigations into\r\nthe misclassification of employees by specific industries.&#160; &#8220;The IRS is\r\nnot initiating or participating in any new industry-specific investigations in\r\nthis area,&#8221; he said. &#160;The Department of Labor will refer some cases for\r\nIRS to follow up with further investigation, Shulman said.

aS'136 young \r\nadults ages 16-20 died in Missouri car accidents in 2008. Teenage drivers are at\r\n great risk of being involved in fatal car wrecks or in wrecks that \r\ncause injury. In fact, <a target="&#95;blank" href="http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2012/09/24/curbing-teen-driving-dangers">U.S. News</a>\r\n reported that car crashes are the number one killer of teens in the \r\nU.S. and that teen drivers are three times as likely to get into a fatal\r\n wreck as an adult driver.\r\n<p>These statistics are enough to frighten any parent and to get every \r\nparent asking questions about how to help reduce the risk of teen car \r\naccidents and keep their kids safe. Our <a href="http://www.tbmlaw.com/">attorneys</a>\r\n want parents to be aware that their own behavior and actions can make a\r\n big difference in how their kids drive. &#160;For parents who want to do \r\neverything possible to stop teen car accidents, this means being \r\nactively involved and modeling good behavior.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Teens Take Cues From Their Parents on Safe Driving</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to a <a target="&#95;blank" href="http://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1080703&#95;teen-drivers-texting-much-more-than-parents-think-study">University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute</a>\r\n study, a parent&#8217;s behavior when driving can have a very significant \r\nimpact on how a teen behaves. The study revealed, for example, that \r\nparents who:</p>\r\n<ul><li>Always wear their seat belts</li><li>Refrain from texting and driving</li><li>Follow safe driving rules</li></ul>\r\n<p>are much more likely to have teenagers who do the same. In fact, a \r\nCSRC principal engineer and teen driving safety expert indicated that \r\nparents should <em>always</em> set a good example for their child when driving from the time their child is young.</p>\r\n<p>Parents who text, speed, talk on cell phones or otherwise behave in \r\nan unsafe way are, on the other hand, less likely to have leverage to \r\ntell their kids not to do the same. Kids will take cues and learn what \r\nis acceptable from watching their parents, and the idea of &#8220;Do as a I \r\nsay, not as a I do,&#8221; doesn&#8217;t necessarily appear to be very effective at \r\nencouraging kids to make safe driving choices.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Talking To Your Kids is Important Too </strong></p>\r\n<p>Setting an example with your own behavior is one key way to encourage\r\n your children to be safe and not take dangerous or unnecessary risks \r\nwhen they are driving. Do not drive while texting or intexticated.</p>\r\n<p><a target="&#95;blank" href="http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2012/09/24/curbing-teen-driving-dangers">US News</a> reported on a State Farm survey addressing teen car \r\naccident risks and dangers. According to the results of the survey, \r\nteenagers who indicated that their parents had clear driving rules and \r\nthat their parents were supportive were about half as likely to become \r\ninvolved in a car wreck than teenagers with parents who didn&#8217;t choose to\r\n be actively involved in setting limits and supervising driving.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Talk To Your Teen Over the Holiday</strong></p>\r\n<p>These statistics show that what you do can make a real difference and\r\n have a big impact on whether your teenager drives safely or not. Since a\r\n simple conversation about safe driving may be the thing that saves your\r\n child&#8217;s life, it is a good idea to have the conversation as soon as \r\npossible and to have it often.</p>\r\n<p>This holiday break presents an ideal time to discuss\r\n safe driving when you and your kids are both home with time on your \r\nhands. So, this holiday season, take the time to talk to your teenager \r\nabout safe driving and about how unnecessary risks put his life and the \r\nlives of innocent victims.</p><br /><!--more-->The dangers of texting in driving for teens and victims.'

aS'<p>I had the privilege last week of carrying the briefcase for my senior partner, <a href="http://www.plaxenadler.com/baltimore-attorneys/attorney-bruce-plaxen/">Bruce Plaxen</a>.</p><p>In a Prince George&#8217;s County trial we represented a woman who was injured when an undercover police car, driven by an off-duty police officer, moved into her lane of travel and hit her head-on. Her medical bills were nearly $400,000.</p><p>She had fractures in her hip, her pelvis, her right foot and her jaw. She needed double knee surgeries. She spent three months in the hospital, and another two months in a wheelchair. Our 45-year-old client now walks with a cane, and is not able to work. More than two years after the collision, she still goes to physical therapy three times a week.</p><p>The jury&#8217;s verdict: $3,091,291.67.</p><p>Verdicts like this are sometimes like monopoly money. The jury probably thinks they did a great thing for this woman &#8212; they probably think that she will now be able to take care of herself and her children. They gave her money for her medical bills, her past and future lost wages, and $1.75 million in non-economic damages (damages for pain, mental anguish, disfigurement and physical impairment).</p><p>The jury did its job, and from their end, justice was served. But now, we have the aftermath.</p><p>Maryland has a statutory cap on non-economic damages. That means that the most our client can recover for non-economic damages is $710,000. If that was the only issue, our client would end up with $2.05 million. But the deeper problem is insurance coverage. There are two issues:</p><p>First, Prince George&#8217;s County was self-insured to the minimum statutory amount &#8212; then $20,000. That level of insurance, given the high cost of medical care, is simply irresponsible. The net effect of that low level of coverage is that people with serious injuries (to say nothing of those with catastrophic injuries) will not be able to pay back their medical bills.</p><p>The woman injured in the collision was forced to rely on her own underinsured motorist coverage.&#160; Unfortunately, it only provided an additional $30,000 in benefits, leaving her with a total recovery of $50,000. That is a fraction of what the jury intended.</p><p>Situations like this are not uncommon. People involved in collisions caused by others are frequently forced to rely on the negligent driver&#8217;s paltry insurance coverage.</p><p>All drivers should review their uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage with their insurance agents. A minimum of $1 million in coverage is a little added security (but, talk to your insurance agent to determine what is best for you), and for most insurance companies the increase in premiums is not extreme.</p><p>This is one little thing we can all do to protect ourselves and our families from being truly victimized by the negligence of others.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in </em><a href="http://thedailyrecord.com/"><em>The Daily Record</em></a><em>.

aS'<p>\r\nEstoppel Certificates serve a salient purpose to landlords, lenders and potential buyers of commercial property. Let us explore the salience and legal effect of such Certificates to some extent and further educate ourselves about them.\r\n</p><p><b>WHAT IS A ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE?</b></p><p>An Estoppel Certificate is a signed statement by tenant or landlord certifying certain information as to the commercial premises. Estoppel Certificate is often required by lenders or potential buyers in refinancing or sale of commercial properties. In addition, it is possible for tenants to use Estoppel Certificates while seeking transfer of their interest under the lease, if possible. </p><p>Estoppel Certificates could literally derail a potential sale or refinancing, as lenders or buyers dissect the enclosed information as to the viability or liability of the building.</p><p><b>WHAT IS THE SALIENCE OF ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE?</b></p><p>Estoppel Certificate provides some clarification and confirmation to interested parties in sale, refinancing or, to a lesser extent, transfer of commercial properties. The information to be provided on an Estoppel Certificate includes, but not limited to the following: </p><ul><li>Clarify Whether the Lease Still is Enforceable or Not</li><li>Clarify Whether the Lease Contains any Changes, Amendments, Modifications, Assignments or Not</li><li>Clarify Whether the Lease Contains any Defaults</li><li>Clarify What the Lease\' Essential Terms and Provisions Are, Such As: The Amount of Rent, The Place of Rent, The Rights Under the Lease Bestowed on Tenant(s).</li></ul><p>Hence, by seeking such information, the most salient questions tends to become clearer, i.e. how much money is the property making? What are the existing or potential problems? The following lists some potential pitfalls for lender or potential buyer:</p><br /><ul><li>Whether The Tenant is Solvent.</li><li>Whether There are Still Renewal Option for the Property and Whether Such Rights have or Are Being Exercised.</li><li>Whether There Are any Violations of the Lease Agreement.</li><li>Whether There Are Any Security Deposits, How Much They Are and Where They Are, If Possible.</li></ul><b><p>SALIENT NOTE</p></b>Given the salience of Estoppel Certificate, most leases contain a clause obligating tenant to provide it when requested. It might be possible for the tenant to negotiate a clause which obligates the landlord to provide the same document when and if tenant reasonably requests.&#160;&#160; <p>&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;</p><p><i><a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Doron-F-Eghbali.aspx"><b>DORON EGHBALI </b></a>Is a Partner at the Beverly Hills Offices of <a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/" target="&#95;blank">Law</a></i><a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/"> </a><i><a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/">Advocate Group, LLP. </a><a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Doron-F-Eghbali.aspx" target="&#95;blank">Doron</a> Primarily Practices <a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Practice%20Areas/Business%20Law.aspx" target="&#95;blank">Business</a>, <a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Practice%20Areas/Real&#95;Estate&#95;Law.aspx" target="&#95;blank">Real Estate</a> and <a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Practice%20Areas/Entertainment&#95;Law.aspx" target="&#95;blank">Entertainment Law</a>. <a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Doron-F-Eghbali.aspx" target="&#95;blank">Doron</a> Can Be Reached at: 310-651-3065.

aS'<p>Many times we get call here at William Muhr attorneys from a victim indicating that they were in a <a href="http://www.williammuhr.com/">Denver auto accident</a>, but\r\nthe accident may have occurred several months ago. With all of the potential\r\ncomplications surrounding an auto accident, including fixing your car, getting\r\nit towed, getting a rental, getting to work, etc, many people forget to take\r\ncare of themselves because they do not believe they have an injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone will get into a car accident at some point in their life. If you\r\nlive in Denver you are especially prone, because Denver is rated as having one\r\nof top three worst driving conditions of all the cities in the US. (Probably\r\nbecause so many people move here from places that do not have snow, and the\r\nfact that while most of the time road conditions are pretty good-when they get\r\nbad they get bad fast and messy in the Denver area) In the Denver area alone,\r\nthis means that approximately 5,860 people will be rear ended in 2010. Everyone\r\nresponds differently to be being rear-ended, but most likely you will be\r\ninjured due to the unique set of forces that the occupant is exposed to in a\r\nDenver auto accident. Whiplash type problems became commonplace with the\r\nintroduction of the train. The quick force of a sudden start or stop tears\r\nthrough muscles, ligaments, tendons, the joint capsule, nervous tissue, and\r\nsometimes even bone. You can be injured even though no damage is shown on your\r\ncar, in fact, it is well known that vehicle damage has no correlation to\r\noccupant injury. If you are ever involved in an auto accident, here is some information\r\nthat will help you get through the stress of dealing with the situation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Check for injuries, at hesitate to call an ambulance when in doubt.<br />\r\n2. Call 911-don&#8217;t rush past or let someone talk you out of calling 911.<br />\r\n3. Take photographs of the scene-another valuable reason to have an iPhone or\r\nother camera phone.<br />\r\n4. Whatever you do, do not leave the scene before the police arrive.<br />\r\n5. Move cars to a safe place so that you and other drivers are safe.<br />\r\n6. Make notes about specifics of the accident. Where and how did it happen,\r\nwhat is the damage to the cars, etc.<br />\r\n7. Get the other drivers information. Name, vehicle make and model, insurance\r\ninfo,<br />\r\n8. Get information from witnesses-if they will let you-why not use the video\r\ncamera on your phone?<br />\r\n9. If you are injured, and not in need of an emergency room visit.

aS'When people become severely, chronically ill or they simply advance \r\nin age, they tend to encounter the need for ongoing care with regards to\r\n their daily routines. Many times, these needs are met by moving into an\r\n assisted living center despite the fact that this is often not a happy \r\nor exciting decision for that resident. No one wants to give up the \r\nfreedoms that most of us take for granted throughout most of our lives, \r\nand many people who do make this decision regret it because they are \r\nmistreated in these settings.\r\n<p>Below you will find a brief overview of the specifics regarding two \r\ndifferent types of mistreatment that tend to occur in an assisted living\r\n center: nursing home negligence and nursing home abuse. Anyone who is \r\nbeing mistreated or any family member who suspects that a loved one is \r\nbeing subjected to this conduct needs to obtain the advice and guidance \r\nof <a href="http://www.mglawyers.com/index.php">experienced San Diego personal injury lawyers</a> as soon as possible.</p>\r\nNursing Home Negligence Described\r\n<p>Nursing home negligence is conduct that can basically be described as\r\n providing a substandard level of care that may or may not be \r\nintentional. Basically, this legal claim can and often is made when the \r\nlevel of ongoing care and oversight that was promised is not delivered. \r\nExamples of results of nursing home negligence can include the \r\ndevelopment of bed sores from not being turned enough for patients who \r\nare immobile, the development of sickness when medications are not \r\nprovided in a regular manner and the suffering of physical injuries when\r\n a resident is not properly supervised.</p>\r\nNursing Home Abuse Described\r\n<p>Nursing home abuse is generally considered to be more egregious \r\nconduct, and that&#8217;s likely because there is some level of intent that is\r\n often present in the minds of the people who are doling out this abuse.\r\n Specifically, people who suffer from abuse in nursing homes can be \r\nphysically abused, emotionally abused, financially abused and even \r\nsexually abused. Any or all of these forms of abuse obviously lead to an\r\n enormous level of harm that can manifest itself by way of physical \r\ninjuries, emotional trauma, financial loss or an increased level of \r\nseverity of sickness that was already being endured by the resident when\r\n he or she moved into the facility.</p>\r\nHow San Diego Personal Injury Lawyers Can Help\r\n<p>When someone is being neglected and/or abused while living in an \r\nassisted living center, it can be difficult for family members to catch \r\non to what&#8217;s happening. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s rare that the person being \r\nmistreated will say something and not all injuries that are suffered are\r\n obvious. Therefore, people need to trust their instincts and to take \r\naction if they suspect something is wrong.</p>\r\n<p>If you or someone you love is being mistreated while living in an assisted living center, you need to seek the help of <a href="http://www.mglawyers.com/index.php">San Diego personal injury lawyers</a> who have been fighting for the rights of clients for many years.

aS'<p class="MsoNormal" MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt">There are many sources of stress for teachers in our public school system these days. There always seems to be another standardized test for which the students need to be prepared. Parents are calling or even stopping by unexpectedly to demand information about their child\'s progress. And, especially in high schools, those who lead instruction in the classrooms are faced with teenagers who often are as worried about their social status or upcoming athletic competition as writing tonight\'s English essay. However, no matter how many challenges a teacher faces every day, the answer is never to turn to illegal narcotics to ease the daily tension. <br /><br />Sean Thomas, a teacher at <a href="http://hs.houstonisd.org/WorthingHS/">Worthing High School</a>, was discovered to be carrying <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6111207.html">marijuana while on the school\'s campus</a>. His stash was found by a drug dog during a search of the employee parking lot. He has been charged with possession in a drug-free zone and suspended with pay while the investigation unfolds. <br /><br />There is one student who I am sure is particularly unhappy with Mr. Thomas\' need to bring pot to the school, which is part of the <a href="http://www.houstonisd.org/">Houston Independent School District</a>.

aS'<p class="MsoNormal">\r\nOne of the most common causes of San Diego bicycle accidents is driver negligence. Negligence is defined as &#8220;failure to exercise reasonable care.&#8221; Sadly, many cyclists suffer as a result of a driver&#8217;s inability to exercise reasonable care when operating a car. Some examples of driver negligence, include: </p><p class="MsoNormal" /><ul><li>Driving while talking or texting on a cell phone</li><li>Driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs</li><li>Failure to obey traffic signs or signals</li><li>Failure to check mirrors when backing up or making a turn</li><li>Driving while tired</li><li>Driving above the speed limit</li><li>Failure to yield the right of way.</li></ul><p /><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Consequences of Driver Negligence</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">According to the California Highway Patrol (CHP), hundreds of cyclists are injured in collisions with cars every year in San Diego. Cyclists&#8217; injuries are usually catastrophic due to the fact that cyclists have nothing but a helmet to protect them from an impact with a car. Examples of catastrophic injuries are: head injuries, broken bone injuries, blunt force trauma, torn muscles and ligaments, brain injuries, severed limb injuries, large puncture wounds, and spinal cord injuries. Tragically, many San Diego cyclists suffer fatal injuries. In 2009, 57 cyclists were killed in San Diego bicycle accidents, reports the CHP.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>See Justice Served</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">After suffering a serious injury in a San Diego bicycle accident caused through no fault of your own, you may be wondering what, if any, justice can be sought? How can the driver of the car that hit you be held accountable? Oftentimes, filing a personal injury claim is the only way victims can ensure the at-fault driver is held accountable. However, before the driver can be made to pay for the harm they have caused, you must prove the driver acted negligently and as a result of the driver&#8217;s negligent behavior, you were harmed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A skilled San Diego bicycle accident lawyer should have the resources and knowledge needed to help you prove negligence on the part of the driver.

aS'<div>personal injury attorneys, their clients and the defendants in the injury lawsuit often enter agreements that allow the defendant pay the compensation over a period of time. There are several sides to this arrangement and of course, this arrangement would have to be properly discussed between the claimant and the personal injury attorney.<p /><p><b>How Structured Settlements Work</b></p><p>Once a verdict has been given in favor of the claimant, the defendant usually offers to pay the stipulated amount in periodic payments. Usually, the terms of the agreement are usually set out between the defendant&#8217;s insurer and the personal injury attorney. The usual practice on the defendant&#8217;s (or the insurance company) part is to find a means of transferring the payment. A lot of times, this involves the taking out of a life insurance policy directly or allocating the responsibility to another party to look for the means of paying for the obligation. The modalities for the setting up of a structured settlement are contained in the appropriate section of the US Internal Revenue Code. So what are the advantages of accepting a structured settlement?</p><p><b>Sound Financial Decision</b></p><p>A lot of times, the victims of injury cases often end up squandering the compensation on luxury items instead of making sound financial plans that make the money last longer. As a result of these occurrences,&#160;personal injury attorneys&#160;and several organizations in the country actually advocate the structured payment of compensations. According to renowned financial writer, Suze Orman, structured payments provide a continuous source of income and are predicated on sound financial plans which allow claimants make sound financial decisions. Every&#160;personal injury attorney&#160;is well aware of the benefits of structuring payments.</p><p><b>Tax deductions</b></p><p>Structured settlements also allow savings on the amount of tax that can be deducted from compensation funds. This is particularly better if the terms are properly set up to utilize the legal loopholes that can reduce the amount of tax that you will be entitled to pay.</p><p><b>Future Requirements</b></p><p>Structured Payments also allow adequate provision for future needs such as a child&#8217;s college fees or medical equipments.</p><p>With these advantages, opting for structured payments is quite sensible.

When an employee applies for workers compensation insurance, he or she will be questioned by supervisors, human resource representatives, and an insurance claims adjuster. It is advisable to be prepared for dealing with the claims adjuster, since that adjuster will ultimately decide to accept or deny the claim. The injured worker should be prepared to explain the incident and support the claim with evidence.</p><p><b>Explaining the incident</b></p><p>During interrogation the claims adjuster will ask many questions related to the injury. The injured worker may be asked to explain the incidents surrounding the injury repeatedly. The ultimate aim of the insurance adjuster is to check the honesty of claims. The best way to prepare is to recall the incidents that occurred during the injury and to be able to explain them in chronological order without any confusion.</p><p><b>Gathering evidence</b></p><p>Gather all evidence and testimonials to support your claim for the injury. Remember that insurance adjusters actually work for the employer and hence he/she will always try to reduce the claim to a minimum amount. </p><p>You need to have all medical reports, physicians report, contact information from witnesses, and other documents ready to support the degree of your disability. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims&#95;adjuster" target="&#95;blank">insurance adjuster</a> will calculate the benefits based on your average weekly wages. Hence, be clear with your average weekly wage payments and show pay slips, if required, to support your claim. Otherwise, the adjuster might undervalue your weekly wages and you could end up receiving fewer benefits.</p><p><b>Seeking guidance</b></p><p>You should know all your rights and privileges within the workers compensation system, so that you can make sure all your rights are protected by the insurer. You should be clear on the entire range of financial and medical benefits applicable to your injury before you meet with an insurance adjuster. </p><p><b>An attorney can help you prepare for your workers compensation case</b></p><p>The best way to learn about your rights is to seek the guidance of experienced, capable legal counsel who can explain how the process works.

Can I get reimbursed for the wages I have lost while recovering from my injuries?</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">A. Possibly. If it is determined that you were not at-fault for the motorcycle accident, you may be able to pursue compensation for lost wages from the at-fault party. If the accident was caused through no fault of your own, you may also be able to recover compensation for medical care costs, caregiving services, occupational rehabilitation, physical therapy, physical pain, disability, diminished quality of life, and emotional suffering.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q. Why is an investigation of my case so important?</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">A. A prompt and thorough investigation of your case is important for several reasons. One reason why an investigation should be conducted immediately is the preservation of evidence. Insurance companies typically have an investigator on the scene of an accident within hours of a crash occurring. In an attempt to diminish the value of a claim, an insurance company may tamper with evidence. An investigation can also reveal who was responsible for the crash occurring. If several parties are found to be at-fault for a motorcycle collision occurring, several parties may be liable. </p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q. How much can compensation can I recover?</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">A. Every motorcycle accident is unique and therefore, every motorcycle accident claim settlement will vary. The outcome of a settlement will depend on many factors, including the severity of the injury, the type of injury, and the experience of the attorney handling the case. A Victorville motorcycle accident attorney with years of experience handling personal injury claims can recover up to four times more compensation than if a victim were to handle the case on their own or with the assistance of an inexperienced lawyer.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q.

There are rules associated with writing a will, whether it is formally drafted by a professional, or if it is written by a person for their own benefit.

It must be wholly written in the handwriting of the testator.</div><div></div><div>2. It must be signed by the testator.</div><div></div><div>Unlike a formal will, a holographic will does not need to be acknowledged by two witnesses, but it must still be readily identifiable as a will. The written document must be a final and lasting statement of one&#8217;s intent for their property. The courts call this &#8220;testamentary intent.&#8221; This means that a list of property, notes about what to do with said property, or a memo of thoughts concerning a person&#8217;s estate would not meet this test because these are considered intermediate steps, intended to be converted into a last will &amp; testament.</div><div></div><div>With the increase in internet-based kits that claim to be &#8220;all you need&#8221; to write your own wills and legal documents, it is important to remember that very often these kits do not meet the basic requirements established by the state. It is very difficult and expensive to remedy a will that has been found to be insufficient, and that cost will be born by your surviving loved ones. Although the intent of a will is to clearly guide your family and loved ones, an invalid will could actually result in a hardship for them.

aS'First, what is a &#8220;personal injury?&#8221;  In the context of this article a personal injury is an injury to your body, mind or emotions that was caused by someone else.  If you have suffered an injury at the hands of another party, you may be eligible to file a personal injury lawsuit.  There are all different kinds of personal injuries -- traffic accidents, assaults, accidents in the home, product defect accidents (product liability), medical and dental accidents, industrial diseases, asbestosis, chest diseases (emphysema, pneumoconiosis, silicosis, chronic bronchitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic obstructive airways disease), occupational deafness, stress, dermatitis and repetitive strain injury.  \r\n\r\nAll of these are personal injuries suffered for various reasons and in different places like work or home or out on our nations roads.  Personal injuries that wind up in lawsuits happen every day in every way across the country.  However, not all injuries will necessarily turn into personal injury lawsuits.  If you stub your toe on the way to the bathroom does that qualify as a personal injury?  Well, it may be an injury but it\'s not necessarily a personal injury lawsuit.  If someone walking by drops a huge metal weight and shatters your toe that is more likely a personal injury lawsuit.  The key element in a personal injury lawsuit is that the harm done to your body was caused by the negligence of another.  If someone else caused injury to your body, mind or emotional well being then you may be eligible to file a personal injury lawsuit which may in turn allow you to collect monies for medical, hospital legal and some cases punitive rewards. \r\n\r\nIf you are not 100% sure, it can never hurt to take a few minutes and contact a personal injury lawyer to find out more.  Remember, the best course of action is to report your injury to medical and legal professionals as fast as possible.  The faster you do talk to a personal injury legal expert, the fresher the facts about your accident will be and the quicker a legal action can be made on your behalf.  Your personal injury attorney will walk through every moment of the accident, of how you were injured, review your case and then determine whether or not you have grounds to bring a legal action and seek financial compensation.  If it does go forward, your lawyer will handle the legal proceedings.  A personal injury attorney will help you sort out what can be very complicated medical information, help you deal with your insurance company and most importantly, they will help you walk through the entire personal injury lawsuit from start to finish. \r\n\r\nIf you have suffered a personal injury of any type and need help determining whether or not you have a case,  seek the advice and counsel of an experienced personal injury attorney as soon as possible to determine what legal options you may have.

aS'<p>A few weeks ago, U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement (ICE) announced a plan to terminate its detention operations at the Varick Street Facility by the end of February. The facility, which is at 201 Varick Street, New York, NY, will continue to operate as a processing center.&#160; That facility is said to house about 300 detainees at a time. A recent report in the New York Times said more than 11,000 men pass through this facility each year. These men are mostly longtime residents of New York.&#160; ICE&#8217;s plan calls for the transfer of these immigration detainees to the Hudson County Jail in Kearney, New Jersey, where they will be kept separated from local criminal inmates.</p><p>ICE officials see the plan as having important benefits. First of all, from a budgetary point of view, ICE officials have calculated that the daily cost of maintaining these detainees will be reduced by more than 50%.&#160; Secondly, this would serve the goal of bringing all immigration detention operations into conformity with national detention standards in that the transfer of the detainees to the Hudson County Jail will provide access to outdoor recreation space and better visitation services not available at the Varick Federal Detention Facility. While cost savings for ICE and quality of detention life are significant issues, I believe this plan will be disadvantageous for New Yorkers housed in New Jersey jails in terms of legal representation and family access.<br />It has been reported the transferred detainees will continue to have their cases heard at the Immigration Court at 201 Varick Street, New York, NY.&#160; This will be convenient for the detainees\' New York families, friends, and attorneys.&#160; However, this means ICE will have the extra expense of transporting the detainees between New Jersey and New York for their court hearings.&#160; This expense, together with van fleet maintenance, will partially offset the cost savings of housing them in New Jersey.&#160; Another issue is ICE&#8217;s reliability in producing detainees for Varick Street hearings.&#160; It should be noted that ICE has been transferring detainees from Varick Street to various county jails in New Jersey for years.&#160; For many of these detainees, their immigration court venue remained at 201 Varick Street.&#160; During those years, we and other <a href="http://www.bretzlaw.com/aop/NYC-green-cards/">green card attorneys in New York City</a> have often appeared at that court, only to find that ICE had failed to bring our clients from New Jersey for the hearing.&#160; Whenever this occurs, it is an inconvenience for us, a disappointment for their families, and a waste of resources by ICE.&#160; </p><p>Attorneys, relatives, and friends, will have to go to the extra trouble of journeying to New Jersey for visits. This means extra cost in time, money, and inconvenience that otherwise would not be incurred if an immigration detention facility were in New York City. Notwithstanding the &#8220;better visitation services&#8221; touted by ICE, the distance and cost of traveling to New Jersey raises the possibility that family visits for the detainees may become fewer and farther between.</p><p>This article was provided by Mr. Kerry Bretz of Bretz &amp; Coven, located 305 Broadway, Suite 100, New York, NY 10007-1109.&#160; Bretz &amp; Coven is a respectable firm aiding clients with <a href="http://www.bretzlaw.com/firm-overview/" target="&#95;blank">New York City immigration help</a>.</p><!--more-->Bretz &amp; Coven is a respectable firm aiding clients with <a href="http://www.bretzlaw.com/firm-overview/" target="&#95;blank">New York City immigration help</a>.

aS'The number of baseball players who suffer head injuries and \r\nconcussions is on the rise, leading to speculation that the recent focus\r\n of attention on football players with TBIs may be seeping into the \r\nbaseball world.&#160; At least 18 players have suffered head injuries severe \r\nenough to land on the disabled list this season, five more than were \r\nreported last season.\r\n<p><b>Who Is Most At Risk?</b></p>\r\n<p>While it is easy to see how football players could be in danger of \r\nconcussions or TBIs, fans may have a little more trouble understanding \r\nhow a baseball player is at serious risk.&#160; After all, the players wear \r\nreinforced batting helmets and the catchers wear masks, so they should \r\nbe protected.</p>\r\n<p>However, it turns out that catchers are at the highest risk of \r\nconcussion injuries of any player, representing 55 percent of this \r\nyear&#8217;s DL list for concussion.&#160; One catcher, Boston Red Sox&#8217;s David \r\nRoss, was on the list twice during the season for concussion injuries.&#160; \r\nSome, such as John Jaso, were out for far longer than the normal \r\nseven-day mandated period and have lost the opportunity to play for the \r\nseason.</p>\r\n<p><b>Are There Really More Concussions?</b></p>\r\n<p>Some experts believe that the number of concussion injuries is not \r\nrising but that awareness of these injuries is increasing.&#160; After the \r\nrecent NFL settlement in which the organization agreed to pay players \r\nmillions of dollars to settle old head injury claims, all sports have \r\nbecome aware of the possible implications of a head injury.</p>\r\n<p>Concussions were once thought to be minor, but recent studies have \r\nshown that the effects can linger for months or years after an injury.&#160; \r\nBecause everyone is individual when it comes to healing patterns, it is \r\nimpossible to say which concussions will heal quickly and which will \r\nrequire further intervention or cause further problems.</p>\r\n<p>For those who have been injured in an <a title="accident" href="http://www.scarlettlawgroup.com/practice-areas/automobile-accidents">accident</a> involving a <a title="Traumatic Brain Injury" href="http://www.scarlettlawgroup.com/practice-areas/traumatic-brain-injury">traumatic brain injury</a>,\r\n an attorney may be able to represent your rights and help you recover \r\ndamages from the person, agency, organization or other entity \r\nresponsible for your TBI.&#160; You may be able to recover money to pay for \r\nmedical treatment and other expenses, depending on the nature of your \r\ninjury.</p>'

aS'<div class="article&#95;body"><p>\r\n  I should have known better. Having previously defended a woman whose \r\ndog barked at a cow; a man who, without a permit, built a shed in his \r\nbackyard; a woman whose dog stepped on the grass of a no-dog park; a \r\ngirl who entered a state park without paying the three dollar entrance \r\nfee - despite the broken fee collection machine; and a man who hung a \r\nsign over his business in violation of the city zoning ordinance, I \r\nshould have expected a struggle. Sadly, I had been told so many times, \r\n&quot;The law is the law.&quot;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  My client was a wife and middle-aged mother of two young children who \r\nshe drove to school Monday through Friday. She also worked a full time \r\njob located a substantial distance from her home. She had no prior \r\ncontacts with the law; until now.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  She called me about a month ago and told me of her past evil doings. \r\nWhen she was a teenager living in another state, she accidentally caused\r\n an automobile accident. As a result, that state required her to \r\npurchase the expensive SR-22 insurance. She did. Many years later, she \r\nmoved to Arizona where she was informed she was not required to purchase\r\n the SR-22 insurance. She didn\'t.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  The first state then suspended her privilege to drive and promptly \r\nnotified Arizona. Because she was suspended in the other state, Arizona \r\nsuspended her license as well. After being notified of the suspensions, \r\nmy client immediately paid a small fee to the other state and was \r\nreinstated. At my client\'s request, the other state sent a clearance \r\nletter to Arizona. Arizona informed her that they received the clearance\r\n letter and everything was fine. Arizona didn\'t inform her that she \r\nneeded to pay a reinstatement fee. As a result, my client drove for \r\nyears without knowing her Arizona license remained suspended.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  One day, my client was the unfortunate victim of a small automobile \r\naccident. After the police officer arrived to &quot;help,&quot; it was discovered \r\nthat my client\'s license was suspended. Despite immediately paying the \r\npreviously unknown but all important reinstatement fee, my client was \r\nnonetheless charged with the crime of driving on a suspended license.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  She reasonably thought she could easily resolve the matter in court. \r\nHowever, after being told by the judge that jail was an option and a \r\nsix-month license suspension was mandatory, I\'m sure I was the first \r\nphone call. I wasn\'t optimistic. It was an easy slam-dunk for the \r\nprosecutor. I accepted her case and agreed to try and make a deal to \r\nresolve it quickly. I thought maybe the prospect of my client losing her\r\n job and her kids not being able to go to school would resuscitate some \r\nlong lost spark of compassion buried deep in the spot where the \r\nprosecutor\'s heart used to reside. Yeah right!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  My client\'s case was assigned to Ms. Hitler for prosecution. My \r\nsentimental requests for leniency were immediately smashed with an iron \r\nfist. Ms. Hitler responded with the novel argument, &quot;The law is the \r\nlaw.&quot; Ms. Hitler was angered when I was not persuaded by her favorite \r\nargument and indeed wanted to joust with her supervisor instead. Not \r\nsurprisingly, Ms. Hitler\'s supervisor Mr. Stalin was equally unimpressed\r\n with my arguments. We were forced into a trial. What fun!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  As the trial began, I couldn\'t wait to discover what defense I would \r\nargue to the judge. Incidentally, this is not my favorite way to try a \r\ncase. Ms. Hitler called the &quot;helpful&quot; police officer to the stand who \r\ntestified that she arrived at the accident scene, obtained my client\'s \r\ndriver\'s license and discovered it was suspended. No cross-examination.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Ms. Hitler then moved to admit a certified copy of my client\'s driving\r\n record indicating it was suspended. I objected based on every reason I \r\ncould argue with a straight face. The driving record was admitted and \r\nMs. Hitler rested the state\'s case.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  I don\'t think Ms. Hitler enjoyed it when I then requested that the \r\ncourt enter a judgment of acquittal for my client because the helpful \r\nofficer friendly didn\'t actually see my client driving. Just for fun, I \r\nadded that I wasn\'t calling any witnesses so there could be no rebuttal \r\ntestimony for the state. Because the judge wasn\'t laughing and Ms. \r\nHitler was getting even madder, I added that the helpful officer was \r\nguessing about who was driving the cars. We won.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  After the judge left the bench and my elated client departed, Ms. \r\nHitler felt obligated to enlighten me to the fact that, &quot;Sometimes the \r\ndragon wins.&quot; Upon further inquiry, I learned Ms. Hitler wasn\'t \r\ninitially certain whether my client or I was the dragon she was \r\nreferring to. Apparently, she was absent during &quot;think before you speak&quot;\r\n class at prosecutor\'s school. Eventually, she decided my client was the\r\n dragon.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  The twenty-five minutes of Ms. Hitler bashing that followed was worth \r\nthe price of admission for me. The slaying of the dragon slayer was a \r\nquiet victory that day. One nice family was rescued from a jungle of \r\ncraziness inhabited by a helpful police officer and a prosecutor who \r\ntreats everyone equally.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <a href="http://www.attorneyforfreedom.com/"><b>Attorney Marc J.

aS'Internet sweepstakes companies may be in real trouble. A recent law has \r\nbeen passed in North Carolina that bans video sweepstakes machines. The \r\nban came into effect the first week of December. A great number of \r\noutlets around the state are already closed as a result.<br />\r\n <br />\r\n Critics claim that these so called Internet sweepstakes games are \r\nreally casino styled games. These gambling parlors are not all giving up\r\n and accepting the ban that went into effect on Wednesday, December 1st.\r\n Some of them are choosing to change their games to comply with the \r\nruling. Their basis for resiting the ruling at all lies in one judge\'s \r\nrecent ruling. He found that some of the Internet sweepstakes ban proves\r\n to be too broad. As such, it interferes with the free speech rights \r\nthat people enjoy in playing such games. <br />\r\n <br />\r\n Still other court rulings have not been sufficient to strike down this \r\nruling. Two different trial courts have heard the arguments on why the \r\nlaw is unfair and chosen to allow the ban on all computer and electronic\r\n forms of sweepstakes machines to stand in North Carolina. This means \r\nthat any online and electronic based games in North Carolina that give a\r\n feeling or appearance of casino games like video poker must be \r\nunplugged by Wednesday December 1st. <br />\r\n <br />\r\n Monday, a lawsuit was dismissed by a Wake County Superior Court Judge \r\nnamed Paul Ridgeway. The suit had been brought by one amusement machine \r\ncompany. The judge left the July law that the North Carolina General \r\nAssembly passed on the books. The same week, a judge in Guillford County\r\n claimed that a portion of the law is simply too broad. The lawmakers \r\nhad made the case that such games were actually illegal gambling. It did\r\n not not matter that customers purchase phone time, Internet time, or \r\noffice services before they were permitted to play a computer based game\r\n that gives out possible prizes on a monitor. <br />\r\n <br />\r\n Appeals to the law likely lie ahead. This has created confusion for \r\npolice officers and law enforcement officials around North Carolina. \r\nState gambling officials as well as local police are supposed to begin \r\nenforcing this law this next week, even though there is no consensus on \r\nhow the law will be enforced. <br />\r\n <br />\r\n An advisory letter has been sent out by the office of state Attorney \r\nGeneral Roy Cooper. It is supposed to help clear up the confusion for \r\nlaw enforcement officials who are required to seize these now illegal \r\nmachines. The letter also gives the vendors of such machines and \r\noperators of the sweepstakes parlors the information on what is legal \r\nand how they might side step the law. <br />\r\n <br />\r\n These operators of sweepstakes maintain that their game machines are \r\nfor entertainment purposes and not gambling at all. Since consumers who \r\ncome into the convenience stores or other places where they are located \r\nhave to purchase a product or service in order to be able to play, they \r\nsay that this is not gambling. The computer screens offer prizes and \r\ncash via mouse clicks.<br />\r\n <br />\r\n Other states\' <a href="http://www.aaronkellylaw.com/Articles/Internet-Sweepstakes.shtml" target="&#95;blank">Internet sweepstakes</a> operators and game machine \r\ndistributors are watching the proceedings in North Carolina closely. \r\nThey know that a number of other states will use the precedent in North \r\nCarolina to follow suit. Because of this, even companies with such \r\nmachines that are not based in North Carolina will likely wish to help \r\nout with the court case appeals.'

aS'<p>Spring time is around the corner and the community pools will ready \r\nfor the summer season. Homeowners Associations and Condominium \r\nAssociations that own swimming pools, wading pools, or spas need to be \r\naware of new requirements under the <a target="&#95;self" href="http://www.access-board.gov/about/laws/ADA.htm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (&#8220;ADA&#8221;). In July, 2010, the Justice Department issued new <a target="&#95;self" href="http://www.ada.gov/2010ADAstandards&#95;index.htm">ADA Standards for Accessible Design</a>,\r\n which include mandates for removing barriers to access to pools and \r\nspas. These new Standards apply to any private entity that operates a \r\n&#8220;place of public accommodation,&#8221; which may include an association. If an\r\n association limits use of its pool to its members and their guests, its\r\n pool does not fall under the requirements of the ADA. However, if an \r\nassociation allows non-members of the association to use its pool in \r\nexchange for some form of compensation, its pool may fall under the \r\ndefinition of a public accommodation. If it does, the association will \r\nhave to comply with the new ADA Standards no later than March 15, 2012.<br />\r\nFor a pool with a perimeter of less than 300 linear feet, the new \r\nStandards require either the construction of a sloped entry into the \r\npool with handrails, or the installation of a mechanized lift with which\r\n a disabled person can lower himself into the pool and lift himself out \r\nof it. For a pool with a perimeter of greater than 300 feet, the \r\nassociation must install two means of entry. One of them must be a \r\nsloped entry or mechanized lift. The other may be one of those two means\r\n or a transfer wall, transfer system, or special pool stairs, each of \r\nwhich has detailed specifications in the Standards. These requirements \r\napply to wading pools and spas as well as swimming pools.</p>\r\n<p>It is not always clear in advance whether a specific use of an \r\nassociation pool by non-members renders the pool a place of public \r\naccommodation and, therefore, subject to the requirements of the ADA. \r\nHowever, the cost of litigating a doubtful claim for violation of the \r\nADA may be considerably more expensive for an association than the cost \r\nof compliance with the ADA&#8217;s requirements. If an association has \r\nquestions regarding its status under the ADA, it should consult its \r\nlegal counsel. If an association allows non-members to use its pool and \r\nchooses not to comply with the new ADA Standards for Accessible Design, \r\nit should consult its insurance carrier to determine its coverage for \r\nclaims made pursuant to the ADA.</p>'

If the Settlor(s) has passed away, that \r\nfiduciary duty shifts to the remainder beneficiaries of the Trust.

aS'<p>\r\nWith relatively high unemployment and volatile economic conditions, people have to contend with rather onerous and exorbitant credit card debt accumulated over the years. Such people often make their monthly payments without paying down their credit card debt and accumulating more debt every day. Let us explore some practical options to pay down credit card debt and stanch the bleeding.</p><p><b>1. YOU CAN MAKE YOUR MONTHLY PAYMENTS</b></p><p>If borrowers can make their minimum monthly payments, then they should seriously contemplate debt management plans offered by credit card companies. These plans would often do the following:</p><ul><li>Reduce Your Interest Rates</li><li>Put You On a Scheduled-Payment Plan</li><li>Offer You Fixed Payments</li><li>Do Not Reduce Your Debt, But Make it Manageable</li></ul><p>Such Program makes it possible for borrowers to pay off their debt in five years or so without accumulating more debt.</p><p><b>CAVEATS</b></p><ul><li><b>NEED TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR EXPENSES: </b>Before calling up your credit card company, you need to have your expenses in writing to tell them about your expenses and your ability to make such fixed payments. </li><li><b>NEED TO KNOW THEY WILL CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT UPON YOUR ENROLLMENT: </b>The credit card company closes your account upon your enrollment in this program. </li><li><b>NEED TO KNOW YOUR CREDIT SCORE MIGHT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED: </b>This might adversely affect your credit score. Nonetheless, this adverse impact on your credit score sometimes is much better than carrying a debt with no plan for paying it down in place. In fact, in most cases, credit card borrowers are paying extremely exorbitant interest rates above 23% or so. Without such program, there will be no way for such borrowers to pay down or pay off their debt without a miracle.</li></ul><b><p>2. YOU CANNOT MAKE YOUR MONTHLY PAYMENTS</p><p>A.

In fact, you must make every effort to avoid them. The reason is that they do not have your interests in mind. You SHOULD NOT do the following:<p><b></b></p><ul><li><b>DO NOT PAY THEM ANY UPFRONT FEES: </b>They charge you exorbitant upfront fees, to your detriment, even before they achieve any results. <a href="http://ftc.gov/opa/2010/07/tsr.shtm" target="&#95;blank">New Federal Trade Commission Rules</a>, will prohibit debt settlement firms from charging any upfront fees.</li><li><b>Do NOT SKIP ANY MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENTS: </b>They urge you to skip minimum monthly payments, to your detriment.</li><li><b>DO NOT TRUST THEM IF THEY TELL YOU THEY GUARANTY SUCCESS: </b>They confidently tell you they can certainly help you. However, in fact, most of their clients are worse off when they are done than when they&#160; initially approached such firms.</li></ul><b></b><p><b>B. SETTLE WITH YOUR BANK, WITH EXTREME CAUTION</b></p><p>If you are between 30 days to 90 days past due on your credit card payments, your bank will send you a letter or call you offering debt settlement. You should be very cautious of the offer and accept it with the provisos, among other things:</p><p /><ul><li><b>ENSURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE SETTLEMENT FULLY SATISFIES YOUR FULL DEBT: </b>The letter, on the bank\'s letterhead, states unequivocally your full debt is satisfied by the settlement.</li><li><b>ENSURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE SETTLEMENT TAX RAMIFICATIONS:&#160; </b>The bank will send you FORM 1099, before filling it out contact a tax attorney.

aS'<p /><p>Not too long ago, President Barack Obama made the executive decision that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) branch should focus on deporting criminals.  This is not an amnesty program. However, eligible aliens can, under this program, avoid being deported and get a work permit. </p>\r\n<p>What President Obama has done is to tell DHS, which is a branch of his executive office, who they should pursue and who they should put on hold.  Anybody who is in immigration court proceedings but who does not have a criminal record should have their case deferred.  </p>\r\n<p>President Obama has told ICE and the DHS attorneys to use what is called &quot;<b>prosecutorial discretion.</b>&quot;  Prosecutorial discretion is when the government and its attorneys get to decide who to concentrate on deporting.  The government attorneys, called &quot;Trial Attorneys&quot; or &quot;TAs,&quot; do not have to try to have every person whose file comes across their desk deported.  In fact, in June 2011, John Morton, the Director of ICE, even issued an official memo telling attorneys to use their prosecutorial discretion to focus on the most important and most serious cases.  They can also use their prosecutorial discretion to agree to reopen an older, closed case, or to not oppose your request for immigration relief from the immigration judge.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Deferred action</strong>, or &quot;deferred deportation&quot; is a status you can get when ICE decides not to pursue your immigration case in court.  This is not a decision made by the judge in immigration court.  It is a decision made by the Department of Homeland Security that it does not want to deport you right now.&#160; Deferred action does not last forever.  Usually it is granted for a specific period of time, such as one year.  When it is close to expiring, you can apply to have it renewed.  It does not mean that you can never be deported, just that your removal is &quot;deferred,&quot; or put off until later.&#160; The major benefit of deferred action on your case is that you get a break from being in immigration court.  ICE will not actively pursue your deportation and will leave you alone. You will be able to sleep peacefully at night.  Another big benefit of deferred action is that you will be able to receive a work permit.  As long as your immigration court case is deferred, you will be able to work legally!</p>\r\n<p>DHS is now beginning to follow President Obama&#8217;s instructions to review all immigration cases to decide which to pursue and which to defer.  They will concentrate on deporting people who:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>(a) Are suspected terrorists;</p>\r\n<p>(b) Have committed a felony or many misdemeanors;</p>\r\n<p>(c) Are gang members;</p>\r\n<p>(d) Have violated the human rights of others; and</p>\r\n<p>(e) Have entered the US illegally (without inspection) or overstayed their visas within the last 3 years.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you are in immigration court proceedings or have received a Notice To Appear (NTA) in immigration court, but do not have any of those things, you should contact an immigration attorney right away.  You probably qualify for deferred action and having a good immigration attorney can help you receive it.  Even if you do have one of the above, you should still contact an immigration attorney because there may be a waiver or another option available to you.</p><p>For more answers to frequently asked questions, to chat live with Timothy A.

Baker again noted that since none of the 1,017 potential\r\nadversaries had been identified, &#8220;[t]here is no adversarial process yet.&#8221;&#160; The Court went on to say that &#8220;VPR ignores\r\nthe fact that IP subscribers are not necessarily copyright infringers&#8221; and\r\nrecounted the story of a couple whose house was raided by federal agents after\r\ntheir neighbor used their unsecured IP address to download child pornography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">It should be noted that not all\r\ncourts agree with the position taken by Judge Baker.&#160; In its Motion for Reconsideration, VPR noted nine\r\ncases from districts in the Seventh Circuit in which other judges had permitted\r\nplaintiffs to discover the names and locations associated with the &#8220;defendant&#8221;\r\nIP addresses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">VPR Internationale recently\r\nasked the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals to issue a writ of mandamus\r\nrequiring Judge Baker to reverse his rulings.&#160;\r\nWhile the Court of Appeals denied the petition, it remanded the case to\r\nJudge Baker and &#8220;encouraged&#8221; him to seek briefing on the propriety of letting\r\nthis case proceed as a class action.&#160;\r\nBarring any relief in the district court, the court of appeals granted\r\nVPR Internationale leave to file a second mandamus petition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">At this juncture, however, VPR\r\nInternationale is facing the proverbial Catch-22: it needs the name of at least\r\none defendant to start the adversarial process, but it needs the adversarial\r\nprocess to get that name. </p><p text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://kcwfirm.com/Attorney-Blogs/AttorneyBlog.html">Click here to read more from the attorneys at KCW.</a></p>'

aS"<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When people call me to ask if they need legal representation in filing for disability retirement benefits under FERS or CSRS, I try and provide as &quot;objective&quot; an opinion on the matter as possible.&#160; I represent hundreds of people in filing for, and obtaining, disability retirement benefits; it is my specialty, and it is how I make a living.&#160; At the same time, however, I believe that I can be completely honest in providing guidance as to whether an individual should obtain legal representation, or needs to obtain representation.&#160; For instance, for individuals who have already sent in their disability retirement packets to OPM (via the Agency for those still on the rolls; directly to Boyers, PA&#160;for those who have been separated from service for 31 days or more), I normally advise the applicant to wait -- wait until a decision has been rendered, and hopefully the individual will not have to expend the funds for attorneys fees, and an approval will be in the mail.&#160; On the other hand, every now and then, an applicant who is waiting for a decision from the Office of Personnel Management, will describe the content and substantive materials comprising the disability retirement packet, and certain statements -- during a telephone consultation with me -- concerning what is stated in the applicant's Statement of Disability, will give rise to concern, and in those instances, it may be wise to either withdraw the application, or immediately take steps to supplement the disability retirement packet.&#160; Each FERS or CSRS disability retirement packet is unique, because each individual &amp; individual's medical condition is unique.&#160; That's what makes the practice of law in the field of representing Federal and Postal disability retirement applicants so interesting, and so professionally satisfying.</p><p>Sincerely, Robert R.

aS'<p center" text-align: left;">The final Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) become effective on March 26.  The regulations represent the most sweeping changes to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules since they were first implemented.</p>\r\nThe new regulations include a variety of concepts which will be of general interest to benefit plan sponsors:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Privacy notice updates.</b> The final regulations require several updates to the privacy notice required under the HIPAA privacy rule.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Business associates.  </b>The new regulations change HIPAA rules by (1) expanding the definition of a business associate to include subcontractors and (2) altering what business associate agreements must contain.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Breach notification requirements.  </b>The final regulations provide that an acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of protected health information (PHI) in an impermissible manner is presumed to be a breach unless the covered entity or business associate demonstrates that there is a low probability that PHI has been compromised based on a risk assessment of at least four factors set out in the regulations.  These are:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The nature and extent of the PHI involved, including the nature and extent of the identifiers involved and the likelihood that the data could be reidentified;</li>\r\n\t<li>The unauthorized person who used the PHI or to whom the disclosure was made;</li>\r\n\t<li>Whether the PHI was actually acquired or viewed; and</li>\r\n\t<li>The extent to which the risk to the PHI has been mitigated.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe regulations make other changes as well.  For instance, they increase penalties for noncompliance with HIPAA rules and expand individuals&#8217; rights in several ways (e.g., by allowing patients to ask for an electronic copy of their medical records and setting new limits on how individuals&#8217; information is used and disclosed for fundraising and marketing reasons).\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about these new regulations or their impact on your organization, contact:\r\n\r\n<a href="mailto:jsitman@flblaw.com" target="&#95;blank">Jacob M.

aS'<p left">A/DISCLAIMER TRUST</p><p left">The <a href="http://www.wightlawoffice.com">A/Disclaimer Trust</a> is just like the <a href="http://www.wightlawoffice.com">A/B Trust</a>, with the only difference being the Surviving Spouseis not required to create the B Trust, but has the option of creating the B Trust based on the size of the estate and federal estate taxes. After the first spouses away, the Surviving Spouse would decide whether to create the B trust based on the size of the estate and the estate taxes in effect at the first spouse&#8217;s death. For example, if the estate tax exemption amount was 2 million at the first spouse&#8217;s death and the estate was valued at 4 million, the Surviving Spouse would create the B Trust and place 2 million in the B Trust and 2 million in the A Trust. Each spouse would receive the 2 million exemption which would allow the entire estate to pass without estate taxes upon the Surviving spouses death if the same 2 million exemption amount was in effect at the Surviving spouses death. The advantage of the A/Disclaimer Trust is the flexibility it allows in not creating the B Trust if it is not necessary. The disadvantage of the A/Disclaimer is the possibility of estate taxes in the event the law changes after the first spouse passes away and not protecting the deceased spouse&#8217;s assets in the event the B Trust is not created and the Surviving Spouse remarries.</p><p left" /><p left">For more information on <a href="http://www.wightlawoffice.com">San Diego estate planning law</a>, please visit our website <a href="http://www.wightlawoffice.com">http://www.wightlawoffice.com</a>. </p>'

aS'<p>Drafting contracts is one of the pleasures of practicing law. But if your contract ends up in court, your handiwork will surely be tested by your opponent\'s skilled lawyers attacking every paragraph, sentence and word. This article provides fifty simple tips for writing the contract that is so clear that no one will want to litigate it. </p><p>These tips apply to writing all kinds of agreements: real estate sales contracts, employment contracts, equipment leases, prenuptial agreements, property settlement agreements. They even apply to stipulations and settlements in litigation. Wherever clarity and simplicity are important, these tips will guide you there. </p><p /><ol><p><b>Before You Write the First Word</b> </p><p /><li><b>Ask your client to write down the terms of the contract</b>. This can be in the form of a list, outline or narration. Doing this will help the client focus on the terms of the agreement. <p /></li><li><b>Engage your client in &quot;what if&quot; scenarios</b>. A good contract will anticipate many possible factual situations and set forth the agreement should those facts come into existence. This will flush out many issues that you may not think of on your own. <p /></li><li><b>Ask your client for a similar contract</b>. Frequently, clients will have had a similar transaction in the past or access to contracts for similar transactions. <p /></li><li><b>Check the form books and treatises for a contract form</b>. Typical forms of contracts can be found in form books, such as West\'s Legal Forms and Florida Jur Forms, as well as in treatises and Florida Bar CLE publications. These can be used as the starting point for drafting the contract or as checklists of typical provisions and wording to include in the contract. <p /></li><li><b>Buy forms on disk or CD ROM</b>. Many treatises and form books now come with forms on disk or CD ROM. Capsoft is also selling Florida Bar CLE forms with its HotDocs document assembly software. No matter how you get them, using forms on disk or CD ROM saves time and avoids the errors of typing. <p /></li><li><b>Don\'t let your client sign a letter of intent without this wording</b>. Sometimes clients are anxious to sign something to show good faith before the contract is prepared. A properly worded letter of intent is useful at such times. Just be sure that the letter of intent clearly states that it is not a contract, but that it is merely an outline of possible terms for discussion purposes. See <a href="http://ldcblogs.martindale.com/lawyers/serendipity/#appendc">Appendix C</a>. <p><b>Writing that First Word</b> </p><p /></li><li><b>Start with a simple, generic contract form</b>. The form in <a href="http://ldcblogs.martindale.com/lawyers/serendipity/#appenda">Appendix A</a> is such a form. It provides a solid starting point for the structure of the contract. Like a house, a contract must have a good, solid foundation. <p /></li><li><b>State the correct legal names of the parties in the first paragraph</b>. As obvious as this is, it is one of the most common problems in contracts. For individuals, include full first and last name, and middle initials if available, and other identifying information, if appropriate, such as Jr., M.D., etc. For corporations, check with the Secretary of State where incorporated. (In Florida, call the Florida Division of Corporations at 904-488-9000 or search its corporation and partnership database from its website at <a href="http://ccfcorp.dos.state.fl.us/index.html">http://ccfcorp.dos.state.fl.us/index.html</a>). <p /></li><li><b>Identify the parties by nicknames</b>. Giving each party a nickname in the first paragraph will make the contract easier to read. For example, James W. Martin would be nicknamed &quot;Martin.&quot; <p /></li><li><b>Be careful when using legal terms for nicknames</b>. Do not use &quot;Contractor&quot; as a nickname unless that party is legally a contractor. Do not use &quot;Agent&quot; unless you intend for that party to be an agent, and if you do, then you better specify the scope of authority and other agency issues to avoid future disagreements. <p /></li><li><b>Include a blank for the date in the first paragraph</b>. Putting the date in the first paragraph makes it easy to find after the contract is signed. It also makes it easy to describe the contract in other documents in a precise way, such as the &quot;December 20, 1996, Contract for Sale of Real Estate.&quot; <p /></li><li><b>Include recitals to provide background</b>. Recitals are the &quot;whereas&quot; clauses that precede the body of a contract. They provide a simple way to bring the contract\'s reader (party, judge or jury) up to speed on what the contract is about, who the parties are, why they are signing a contract, etc. The first paragraph in the body of the contract can incorporate the recitals by reference and state that they are true and correct. This will avoid a later argument as to whether or not the recitals are a legally binding part of the contract. <p /></li><li><b>Outline the contract by writing out and underlining paragraph headings in their logical order</b>. The paragraphs should flow in logical, organized fashion. It is not necessary to write them all at once; you can write them as you think of them. Try to group related concepts in the same paragraphs or in adjacent paragraphs. For example, write an employment contract\'s initial paragraph headings like this: <p /><ol><li>Recitals. </li><li>Employment. </li><li>Duties. </li><li>Term. </li><li>Compensation. </li></ol><p /></li><li><b>Complete each paragraph by writing the contract terms that apply to that paragraph</b>. This is simple. You learned this in elementary school. Just explain in words what the parties agree to paragraph by paragraph. <p /></li><li><b>Keep a pad at hand to remember clauses to add</b>. It is normal to think of additional clauses, wording and issues while writing a contract. Jot these down on a pad as you write; they are easily forgotten. Also keep your client\'s outline and other forms in front of you as you write, and check off items as you write them. <p /></li><li><b>Repeat yourself only when repetition is necessary to improve clarity</b>. Ambiguity is created by saying the same thing more than once; it is almost impossible to say it twice without creating ambiguity. Only if the concept is a difficult one should you write it in more than one way. In addition, if you use an example to clarify a difficult concept or formula, be sure that all possible meanings are considered and that the example is accurate and consistent with the concept as worded. <p><b>What to Watch Out for When Writing</b> </p><p /></li><li><b>Title it &quot;Contract.&quot;</b> Do not leave this one to chance. If your client wants a contract, call it a contract. A judge now sitting on the federal bench once ruled that a document entitled &quot;Proposal&quot; was not a contract even though signed by both parties. The lesson learned is, &quot;Say what you mean.&quot; If you intend the document to be a legally binding contract, use the word &quot;Contract&quot; in the title. <p /></li><li><b>Write in short sentences</b>. Short sentences are easier to understand than long ones. <p /></li><li><b>Write in active tense, rather than passive</b>. Active tense sentences are shorter and use words more efficiently, and their meaning is more apparent. <p /></li><li><b>Don\'t use the word &quot;biweekly.&quot;</b> It has two meanings: twice a week and every other week. The same applies to &quot;bimonthly.&quot; Instead, write &quot;every other week&quot; or &quot;twice a week.&quot; <p /></li><li><b>Don\'t say things like &quot;active termites and organisms&quot;</b>. Avoid ambiguity by writing either &quot;active termites and active organisms&quot; or &quot;organisms and active termites.&quot; When adding a modifier like &quot;active&quot; before a compound of nouns like &quot;termites and organisms&quot;, be sure to clarify whether you intend the modifier to apply to both nouns or just the first one. If you intend it to apply to both, use parallel construction and write the modifier in front of each noun. If you intend it to apply to just one noun, place that one noun at the end of the list and the modifier directly in front of it. <p /></li><li><b>Don\'t say &quot;Lessor&quot; and &quot;Lessee.&quot;</b> These are bad nicknames for a lease because they are easily reversed or mistyped. Use &quot;Landlord&quot; and &quot;Tenant&quot; instead. <p /></li><li><b>Watch out when using &quot;herein.&quot;</b> Does &quot;wherever used herein&quot; mean anywhere in the contract or anywhere in the paragraph? Clarify this ambiguity if it matters. <p /></li><li><b>Write numbers as both words and numerals: ten (10)</b>. This will reduce the chance for errors. <p /></li><li><b>When you write &quot;including&quot; consider adding &quot;but not limited to.&quot;</b> Unless you intend the list to be all-inclusive, you had better clarify your intent that it is merely an example. <p /></li><li><b>Don\'t rely on the rules of grammar</b>. The rules of grammar that you learned in school are not universal. The judge or jury interpreting the meaning of your contract may have learned different rules. Write the contract so that no matter what rules they learned, the contract is clear and unambiguous. <p /></li><li><b>Don\'t be creative with words</b>. Contract writing is not creative writing and is not meant to provoke reflective thoughts or controversies about nuances of meaning. Contract writing is clear, direct and precise. Therefore, use common words and common meanings. <p /></li><li><b>Be consistent in using words</b>. If you refer to the subject matter of a sales contract as &quot;goods&quot; use that term throughout the contract; do not alternate calling them &quot;goods&quot; and &quot;items&quot;. Maintaining consistency is more important than avoiding repetition. <p /></li><li><b>Be consistent in grammar and punctuation</b>. The rules of grammar and punctuation you learned may differ from others, but you had better be consistent in your use of them. Be aware of such things as where you put ending quote marks, whether you place commas after years and states, and similar variations in style. <p /></li><li><b>Consider including choice of law, venue selection, and attorneys fee clauses</b>. If your contract gets litigated, you might as well give your client some &quot;ammunition&quot; for the fight. Examples of these clauses appear in Appendices <a href="http://ldcblogs.martindale.com/lawyers/serendipity/#appenda">A</a> and <a href="http://ldcblogs.martindale.com/lawyers/serendipity/#appendc">C</a>. <p><b>Write for the Judge and Jury</b> </p><p /></li><li><b>Assume the reader is a knowledgeable layman</b>. If your writing is so clear that a layman could understand it, then it is less likely it will end up in court. <p /></li><li><b>Define a word by capitalizing it and putting it in quotes</b>. Capitalizing a word indicates that you intend it to have a special meaning. The following are two sample clauses for defining terms: <ul><p>Wherever used in this contract, the word &quot;Goods&quot; shall mean the goods that Buyer has agreed to purchase from Seller under this contract. </p><p>Buyer hereby agrees to purchase from Seller ten (10) frying pans, hereinafter called the &quot;Goods.&quot; </p></ul><p /></li><li><b>Define words when first used</b>. Instead of writing a section of definitions at the beginning or end of a contract, consider defining terms and concepts as they appear in the contract. This will make it easier for the reader to follow. <p /></li><li><b>Explain technical terms and concepts</b>. Remember that the parties might understand technical jargon, but the judge and jury who interpret and apply the contract do not. Therefore, explain the contract\'s terms and concepts within the contract itself. <p><b>Keep Your Client Informed While You Write</b> </p><p /></li><li><b>All contracts should come with a cover letter</b>. This gives you a place to instruct your client on how to use and sign the contract. <p /></li><li><b>Tell your client the ideas that come as you write</b>. Many ideas will occur to you as you write: things that could go wrong with the deal, things that might happen in the future, things that happened in the past, ways to structure things better. Write these in your letter to the client. <p /></li><li><b>Inform your client of the risks</b>. Writing a letter to the client as you write the contract is the perfect way to inform the client of the risks and rewards of entering into the contract. Frequently, problems do not become apparent until time is spent trying to word a contract. <p><b>What To Do After the First Draft Is Written</b> </p><p /></li><li><b>Use your word processor\'s spelling and grammar checker</b>. This almost goes without saying today, especially since Microsoft Word now checks your spelling and grammar as you type. <p /></li><li><b>Let your secretary or paralegal read it</b>. Not only will your staff frequently find spelling and grammar errors missed by your word processor\'s spell checker, but they will find inconsistencies and confusing areas that you missed when drafting. <p /></li><li><b>Stamp &quot;Draft #1 6/21/97&quot; on it</b>. This may be the first of many drafts, so avoid confusion early by numbering and dating all drafts at the top of the first page. It is also a good idea to write &quot;DRAFT&quot; across the face of each page to preclude the possibility of an impatient client signing a draft rather than waiting for the final version. <p /></li><li><b>Let your client read it</b>. Letting the client in on reading the first draft assures that your drafting will stay in tune with the client\'s wishes. <p /></li><li><b>Save the drafts as multiple files on your computer</b>. If you save the first draft on your computer as two files, you will have one file identified as the first draft and the other identified as the current version. This can be done by naming the current version &quot;contract&quot; and the first draft as &quot;contract.d1&quot;. Then, subsequent versions can be named &quot;contract.d2&quot;, &quot;contract.d3,&quot; etc. <p /></li><li><b>Compare the current version to prior versions</b>. If you save draft versions, it is very easy to compare one version to another using the word processor\'s compare feature or using the CompareRite computer program. When you compare &quot;contract.d1&quot; to &quot;contract.d2&quot;, save the comparison as &quot;contract.c21&quot; and print it to show the client what changes were made. <p><b>How to Print and Sign the Final Draft</b> </p><p /></li><li><b>Print the contract on 24 pound bond paper instead of 20 pound copier paper</b>. Using a heavy bond paper will make it easy to tell the original contract from copies. It will also last longer. <p /></li><li><b>Print on pages using the same paper, and if pages are changed, reprint the document using the same paper</b>. This will avoid an argument that pages were substituted after the contract was signed. <p /></li><li><b>Sign the contract in blue ink, not black ink</b>. This, too, will make it easier to differentiate the signed original contract from photocopies. <p /></li><li><b>Initial every page of the contract</b>. Having each party initial each page of the contract will make it less likely that anyone could claim a page was changed after the contract was signed. <p /></li><li><b>Identify the parties and witnesses who sign by providing blank lines below their signature lines for their printed names and addresses</b>. This will make it easier to find the witnesses if the contract is contested. <p /></li><li><b>Be sure that corporate officers include their titles, the corporation name and the word &quot;as.&quot;</b> Failure to do this can result in personal liability of the officer. The proper way to sign in a representative capacity is as follows: <p>ABC Corporation, a Florida corporation</p><p /><p>By:&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;</p><p /><p>John Jones, as its President</p><p /></li><li><b>Add a notary clause that complies with the notary law</b>. The notary acknowledgement in <a href="http://ldcblogs.martindale.com/lawyers/serendipity/#appendb">Appendix B</a> is such a clause. </li></ol><p><b>Concluding Advice</b> </p><p>If these fifty tips don\'t keep your contracts out of court, try mastering Strunk &amp; White\'s Elements of Styles. I hear it\'s real handy in appellate work. </p><!--more-->Drafting contracts in Florida requires good writing skills, legal knowledge and more.'

It results from an agreement between the debtor and one of his or her creditors. However, the security interest created may be of concern to and possibly affect the rights of third parties.&#160; Because bankruptcy affects the rights and priority of creditors, it is very important for creditors to become fully secured in the interest so that they will get paid in full.&#160; Thus, to understand how a creditor becomes fully secured it is essential to understand the concept of attachment.</p><p color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, \'Times New Roman\', \'Bitstream Charter\', Times, serif; line-height: 19px; ">Under Article 9, if a security interest has been created and becomes enforceable as between the two parties, the debtor and the secured property, with respect to a particular piece of property, then it has&#160;<em>attached&#160;</em>to that property. Stated another way, the collateral owned by the debtor is attached to contract when a security interest is created. If the security interest has not attached, it isn&#8217;t enforceable by or against anybody and it is worthless.</p><p color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, \'Times New Roman\', \'Bitstream Charter\', Times, serif; line-height: 19px; ">Accordingly, section 9-203(b) provides that a security interest is enforceable against the debtor and third parties with respect to collateral only if three criteria are met. First, value must have been given by the secured party to the debtor.&#160;This means the secured party must give something of value in some form or another (generally money) to the debtor.</p><p color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, \'Times New Roman\', \'Bitstream Charter\', Times, serif; line-height: 19px; ">Second, the debtor must have actual rights in the collateral. This means the debtor must have ownership or at least the power to transfer rights in the collateral.</p><p color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, \'Times New Roman\', \'Bitstream Charter\', Times, serif; line-height: 19px; ">Third, there must be a signed a security agreement covering the collateral granting the security interest to the creditor. Although some transactions attach automatically and do not require a signed security agreement, this is the general process by which a security interest attaches. In some instances it will be sufficient for the agreement to be oral. However, most often it is a written otherwise recorded security agreement authenticated by the debtor.&#160; Therefore, if any of these three conditions are not met, the transaction fails to create a security interest in the collateral.</p><p color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, \'Times New Roman\', \'Bitstream Charter\', Times, serif; line-height: 19px; ">So attachment of a security interest is about as fundamental as you can get in a secured transactions.

aS'<p>In the wake of the Casey Anthony trial, newfound scrutiny is being directed toward the burden of proof and its role in criminal and civil proceedings.&#160; How could the jury acquit Ms. Anthony in light of the seeming abundance of circumstantial evidence and suspicious behavior?&#160; The answer likely lies in the burden of proof.&#160; The burden of proof is the obligation that a party has to prove his or her claims or defenses.&#160; Trials, in the civil realm and criminal realm, do not determine actual guilt or innocense.&#160; Juries are tasked with determining, based upon the evidence submitted to them at trial, whether the party with the burden of proof has met their burden.&#160; Even where a juror personally believes that an individual has committed a crime, that juror has a duty to acquit a defendant when the prosecutor does not meet the burden of proof.</p><p>In criminal trials, a prosecutor representing the state bears the burden of proof.&#160; The state must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.&#160; What constitutes reasonable doubt depends upon the common sense of a reasonable person.&#160; Reasonable doubt is defined in the Colorado Jury Instructions as follows:</p><p>Reasonable doubt means a doubt based upon reason and common sense which arises from a fair and thoughtful consideration of all the evidence, or the lack of evidence, in the case.&#160; It is not a vague, speculative, or imaginary doubt, but one that would cause reasonable persons to hesitate to act in maters of importance to themselves.</p><p>CJI Civil, 4th: 3:3.&#160; Reasonable doubt is the highest burden of proof required by the American legal system, and poses a daunting hurdle to prosecutors.&#160; In some cases, a defendant may chose not to put on any evidence.&#160; Defendants may chose to call no witnesses and cannot be compelled to testify.&#160; Because the burden of proof lies with the state, and the defendant has no obligation to prove his or her own innocense, a defendant may chose to limit their case to cross examination of state witnesses and opening/closing remarks.</p><p>In civil trials, the plaintiff bears the burden of proof.&#160; Like defendants in criminal trials, defendants in civil trials do not have an evidentiary burdens to meet, with the exceptions of certain affirmative defenses.&#160; If the plaintiff fails to meet his or her burden in proving the case, the jury is required enter a verdict for the defendant.&#160; However, the burden of proof is different in a civil case as opposed to a criminal case.&#160; The burden of proof in a civil case is preponderance of the evidence.&#160; To prove something by a preponderance of the evidence means to prove that it is more probably true than not.&#160; It is often remarked that the preponderance of the evidence standard only requires the plaintiff to prove his or her case by 50.01 percent.&#160; The preponderance of evidence standard is considered to be significantly lower standard than the beyond reasonable doubt standard.&#160; In many cases where an individual is found not guilty in a criminal case, liability has been found in a civil action.&#160; Perhaps the most famous example of this deviation is the case of O.J. Simpson, who was acquitted or murder in a criminal case but held liable in a civil suit.&#160; </p><p>Finally, in some situations, courts use a third standard, called clear and convincing evidence.&#160; The clear and convincing evidence standard is a standard between preponderance of the evidence and reasonable doubt.&#160; A fact has been proven by clear and convincing evidence if a juror finds it to be highly probable and no serious doubt exists.&#160; Oftentimes, the clear and convincing evidence standard is used in specific parts of criminal and civil trials where lawmakers think the burden should be higher or lower than the burden typically used.&#160; For instance, after Jon Hinckley Jr. was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, Congress passed the Federal Insanity Defense Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 17.&#160; Under this act, the burden of proof is upon the defendant to prove insanity by clear and convincing evidence in a federal criminal case.&#160; Under Colorado law, juror damages for non-economic losses are capped at $250,000.00, adjusted for inflation, under C.R.S. &#167; 13-21-102.5.&#160; However, if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that a higher amount is justified, the non-economic loss award can be raised.</p><p>The burden of proof shapes the proceedings and strategies employed in criminal and civil courts.&#160; If you are an injured victim, it is important to remember that you bear the burden of proving your case by a preponderance of the evidence.&#160; If you or a loved one have been injured, call the attorneys at Bell &amp; Pollock today.\r\n\r\n</p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured, call the law firm of Bell &amp; Pollock, P.C., 303-795-5900 or <a title="Denver Injury Attorneys" href="www.bellpollock.com">www.bellpollock.com</a> and <a title="Denver Injury Attorneys" href="www.championsofthepeople.com">www.championsofthepeople.com</a>, Denver Injury Attorneys, Champions of the People.&#160; You can access all of our free podcasts on our website, just click on &quot;Bell &amp; Pollock on the Radio&quot; </p><!--more-->If you or a loved one has been injured, call the law firm of Bell &amp; Pollock, P.C., 303-795-5900 or www.bellpollock.com and www.championsofthepeople.com,\r\n Denver Injury Attorneys, Champions of the People.&#160; You can access all \r\nof our free podcasts on our website, just click on &quot;Bell &amp; Pollock \r\non the Radio&quot;'

aS'<p>At the conclusion of a trial in the judge&#8217;s charge to the jury, the instruction will often be that the &#8220;defendant takes the plaintiff as he finds him&#8221;.

aS'<p>A frequent issue that arises when personal injury cases are about to settle is whether the plaintiff should take the payment in the form of a structured settlement.&#160;</p><p>Structured settlements are payouts over time rather than payment in one lump sum.&#160; As usual, the best course of action depends on the specific situation. In this context it depends upon the parties who are involved and their needs.&#160; Nevertheless, there are a few guiding principles which must be borne in mind.</p><p>Tax implications are always crucial.&#160; Bear in mind that the Internal Revenue Code excludes from a taxpayer&#8217;s gross income amounts received from personal injury awards.&#160; There is an additional tax benefit in a structured settlement.&#160;&#160; When a case has been structured such that it is paid out in the form of an annuity, that entire income stream is tax-free.&#160; In contrast, if a case is resolved in a one- time payment, just the one-time payment is tax-free-&#160; a wonderful benefit-&#160; but any income produced from that money would be taxable.</p><p>The second frequently cited reason for structuring a case is that the plaintiff may not be accustomed to handling a large sum of money.&#160; A pay-out in the form of an annuity is a forced kind of savings.&#160; This is particularly helpful for many people.&#160; <br />One thing that cannot be forgotten in this difficult economic time is that the company paying the structured settlement or annuity should be a company that has a strong rating from the prevailing rating services such as Moody&#8217;s or Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s.&#160; Also, the structure should be guaranteed by yet another company, also with a high rating.&#160; </p><p>The proper structured settlement as part of the resolution of a personal injury case may be advisable.&#160; Just be sure that the safeguards are in place and that the recipient is one who would do well with a structure.&#160; </p><hr />Robert Feinberg<br /><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient-ff&rlz=1B3GGGL&#95;enUS302US302&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=injury+lawyer+boston&fb=1&split=1&gl=us&view=text&latlng=7835227274681323077&ei=8F&#95;wSaTBNNLXlAeYw8DPDA&sa=X&oi=local&#95;result&ct=result&resnum=4" target="&#95;blank">Boston Personal Injury Lawyer</a><p /><!--more--><a href="http://www.feinbergalban.com/" target="&#95;blank">Boston Massachusetts personal injury attorney</a>, Robert Feinberg discusses a frequent issue that arises when <a href="http://www.feinbergalban.com/Firm%20Info/Practice%20Areas/Personal%20Injury.aspx" target="&#95;blank">personal injury cases</a> are about to settle; whether or not the plaintiff should take the payment in the form of a structured settlement.'

aS"The <i>LA Times</i> reported last week, &#8220;Baseball has a long way to go to match the NFL when it comes to embarrassing off-the-field issue&#8230;but with six players having been cited for drunk driving this year, the commissioner's office is seeking wider powers to discipline players involved in alcohol-related incidents.&#8221;<br /><br />After reading the headline, &#8220;Bud Selig seeks ability to discipline off-the-field alcohol-related offenders,&#8221; I remember thinking just how important it is that people in a position of power have the ability to shape our social norms and spread awareness about vital issues like drug and alcohol related offenses, including DUI.&#160; &#160;<br /><br />For example, the <i>Times</i> quoted Pat Courtney (a spokesman) saying the following, &quot;Obviously, any time a player is arrested for DUI or illegal conduct, we're concerned,&quot; and &quot;Alcohol issues are certainly an issue we'll be taking up in negotiations for a new Collective Bargaining Agreement.&quot;<br /><br />This is such great news for everyone and especially for younger fans.&#160; After all, Major League Baseball (MLB) players are considered to be heroes for much of our nations&#8217; youth.&#160; It is refreshing to hear that even though celebrity status might already be attached, the pressure is on to regulate the actions any offender. <br /><br />The Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between MLB and the players union expires Dec. 11 and as part of the negotiations underway, MLB is asking for a provision that would allow Commissioner Bud Selig to discipline players linked to &quot;drugs of abuse&quot; or other illegal conduct away from the workplace, according to the <i>Times</i>. &#160;<br /><br />The bottom line is, players who test positive for marijuana and cocaine are currently ordered to counseling but more can always be done.&#160; The problem with drinking and driving seems to also be on the rise in 2011. &#160;<br /><br />For instance, Cleveland Indians outfielder Shin-Soo Choo is the most recent player to be cited for driving under the influence, the report indicated.&#160; He was stopped by police recently in Sheffield Lake, Ohio, and given a Breathalyzer test that showed the player had a blood-alcohol level of .201 (more than double Ohio's legal limit of .08) said the <i>Times</i>.<br /><br />Others on the list include Choo's teammate, Austin Kearns, Seattle's Adam Kennedy, Detroit's Miguel Cabrera, Oakland's Coco Crisp and Atlanta's Derek Lowe, all of whom have been arrested since Jan. 1 for suspicion of DUI. &#160;<br /><br />Hopefully, if the Commissioner gets his way, the overall number of future offenses will drop and news reports about players will focus more on their ability to entertain America with their skills on the field and not their exploits off it. &#160;"

aS"<p>\r\n\r\nThe new Transfer on Death Instrument recently enacted in Illinois has a hole in its administration that might prove costly to those you use it and lawyers who recommend it or fail to warn of its probelms.</p><p>The new instrument was meant to avoid probate by having real property transferred at death with having to go to court.&#160;&#160; A person could designate someone to receive the property at their death and that is why it is called an &quot;Instrument&quot; and not a &quot;Deed&quot; because it conveys no present interest upon its execution.</p><p>Here's the problem: the person receiving the property may be restricted from selling it or otherwise encumbering it for two years after the death of the Grantor.</p><p>EXAMPLE:&#160;&#160; Uncle Hiram finds that he has only three legal heirs: Moe, Larry and Curley. He decides to leave the farm to Curley because he was the funny one.&#160; Instead of doing a Will which would require Probate, his lawyer advises him to use the new TRANSFER ON DEATH INSTRUMENT.&#160;&#160; Uncle Hiram pens in Curley.&#160; Uncle Hiram passes on.&#160; Curley&#160; is not really a farmer at heart.&#160;&#160; It takes someone with defective olfactory processes or a strong stomach and Curley has neither.&#160; He wants to sell the place --- not so fast.&#160; Moe and Larry are not happy heirs.&#160;&#160; Without their permission, Curley can't sell the place for TWO YEARS.</p><p>If Uncle Hiram had willed it, the probate court would have given Moe and Larry six months to contest the Will but that would have been the cutoff and Curley would have been home free.&#160; Instead, he has to run the place or hire someone to run it for an additional EIGHTEEN MONTHS longer than what probate would have taken.&#160;&#160; Moe and Larry don't have to hire a lawyer and contest the Will --- just do nothing and refuse to comply with Curley's sale of the farm.&#160;&#160; Might cause Curley to pay a visit to Uncle Hiram's lawyer with a lawyer of his own.</p><p>As they say, doctors bury their mistakes; lawyers put their's in writing, often have them notarized and then filed with the courts forever or in some dark chasm of a law firm's musty storage rooms awaiting retrieval.</p><p /><p>Dave Blocher</p><p /><p /><p /><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><!--more-->The new Illinois TRANSFER ON DEATH INSTRUMENT can have unintended consequences --- user beware!"

aS'<p>In an era where more and more out-of-state law firms are entering the market to capitalize on the valley&#8217;s explosive growth, brothers Mark and Chris Albright take pride in calling Albright, Stoddard, Warnick &amp; Albright a hometown, <a title="Las Vegas Law Firm" href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/">Las Vegas law firm</a>.&#160; Through 40-plus years, this <a title="Business and Commercial Law" href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/aop/Las-Vegas-business-litigation/">business law</a> oriented firm has been known for helping hundreds of valley businesses and corporations. The firm&#8217;s attorneys have deep roots in the community.</p><p>&#8220;We have many attorneys who were born and raised here. &#8230; We are not an out-of-state firm that recently decided to open doors here. &#8230; We&#8217;ve seen the growth in this town. We know the business and political environment,&#8221; said Chris Albright.</p><p>Mark and Chris&#8217; father, Vern Albright, now 78, opened the firm in 1966. Prior to going into private practice, he was a former assistant U.S. attorney in Nevada, and deputy district attorney in Clark County. Vern&#8217;s father, Bud Albright, came to the valley in the 1930s with the building of the Hoover Dam, and then became one of the valley&#8217;s well known county commissioners; most notably, becoming known as the father of the Las Vegas Convention Center.</p><p>Albright, Stoddard, Warnick &amp; Albright has represented or counseled some of Nevada&#8217;s longest-running and largest corporate citizens, including: Nevada Power, Nevada<br />Ready Mix, Century Steel, Community Bank, American Asphalt, Harley Davidson, Del Webb, PCL Construction, PBS&amp;J Engineering and others. The firm belongs to the<br />Martindale-Hubbell Register of Preeminent Lawyers and enjoys the highest AV ranking by the register, a distinction held by only five percent of all U.S. law firms.&#160; Ten years ago, Mark Albright, who now holds the title of managing partner, decided, with the legal needs of the community growing, it was time for the firm to expand to become a full-service firm to meet the requirements of local business owners.</p><p>Since then, the firm has grown from nine to <a href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/attorneys/">25 attorneys</a>&#160;today, and now employs some 50 people in a 10,000-square-foot building in the Quail Park office complex on<br />Rancho Drive near the courthouse. Albright, Stoddard, Warnick &amp; Albright is now one of the oldest and largest (top ten) firms in the valley. Today, the firm serves the local<br />business community in the areas of <a title="Business and Commercial Law" href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/aop/Las-Vegas-business-litigation/">business &amp; commercial law</a>,Federal &amp; <a title="Nevada Tax Law" href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/aop/Las-Vegas-tax-law/">Nevada tax law</a>, <a title="Real Estate Law" href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/aop/Las-Vegas-real-estate-law/">real estate law</a>, lending, labor &amp; <a title="Employment Law" href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/aop/Las-Vegas-employment-law/">employment law</a>, <a title="Construction Law" href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/aop/Las-Vegas-construction-law/">construction law</a> and <a title="Insurance Law" href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/aop/Las-Vegas-insurance-law/">insurance law</a>, as well as <a title="Estate Planning" href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/aop/Las-Vegas-estate-planning/">estate planning</a>, <a title="Personal Injury" href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/aop/Las-Vegas-personal-injury/">personal injury</a>, and <a title="Criminal Defense" href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/aop/Las-Vegas-criminal-defense/">criminal defense</a>. The firm is presently<br />defending various subcontractors in over 100 <a title="Construction Defect Litigation" href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/aop/Las-Vegas-defect-litigation/">construction defect</a> cases.</p><p>With a strong reputation to uphold, Mark Albright not only sought attorneys with high-level experience, but who also had professional backgrounds in the fields they represented. Thus, Albright, Stoddard, Warnick &amp; Albright now has attorneys who are also CPAs, accountants, civil engineers, mortgage brokers, lobbyists, MBAs and former prosecutors. These individuals bring a wealth of professional experience along with their legal understanding to help resolve business disputes and better serve as advocates in business litigation. Recently, two attorneys at the firm were honored to become bar examiners and court approved arbitrators. The firm also recently hired a former prosecutor to lead its criminal defense unit.</p><p>The pursuit for these uniquely qualified individuals has yielded some of the field&#8217;s best attorneys, now employed by one of the valley&#8217;s top, most highly-regarded law firms.<br />Some examples include: Curtis Cannon, who practices tax law and is a CPA (recently honored in Texas as a Tax Super Lawyer); Spencer Judd, who has owned his own mortgage business for more than 20 years and specializes in banking and lending law (and has been involved in most of the recent high profile mortgage litigation); and Tony May, a civil engineer/attorney who represents some of the valley&#8217;s most prominent engineering and professional design companies. Bud Stoddard, number one in his class in law school, was recruited from a large national firm in Los Angeles to head the transactional unit. Brad Ballard was recently recruited from another large local firm to defend businesses being sued for personal injuries. Jan Maher and Hilary Muckleroy were recently recruited from other firms for their expertise in construction defect and insurance litigation.</p><p>As a testament to its exacting hiring standards, many of the firm&#8217;s attorneys have also held positions as judicial law clerks prior to working for Albright, Stoddard, Warnick &amp; Albright. The firm recently hired three new attorneys from judicial clerkship posts.</p><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very unique and something we&#8217;re proud of. These are sought after attorneys,&#8221; Mark Albright added. Chris Albright, who clerked for the Nevada Supreme Court, heads the firm&#8217;s appellate division. Mark Albright, who clerked in the Federal Court for Judge George, handles dozens of federal cases. Whitney Warnick continues to chair the estate planning unit.</p><!--more-->In an era where more and more out-of-state law firms are entering the market to capitalize on the valley&#8217;s explosive growth, brothers Mark and Chris Albright take pride in calling Albright, Stoddard, Warnick &amp; Albright a hometown, <a title="Las Vegas Law Firm" href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/">Las Vegas law firm</a>.&#160; Through 40-plus years, this <a title="Business and Commercial Law" href="http://www.albrightstoddard.com/aop/Las-Vegas-business-litigation/">business law</a> o'

aS'<p>\r\n\r\nAttorney David Allen discusses when government is responsible for the harm it causes. He examines a case in which a  man suffers food poisoning after eating in a government cafeteria. The man sued the government. The federal government claimed it was immune from suit. It argued the way it chose to clean up the kitchen was  discretionary. Under the law government cannot be sued for actions which are discretionary -- those things it can decide whether or not it wants to do. The man argued the government cafeteria had regulations regarding hygiene. Since the government imposed regulations, it possessed a mandatory duty to enforce the regulations.

aS'<p>In two recent blogs I wrote of releases that organizations are increasingly using to preclude a <a title="Boston Injury Lawsuit" href="http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2010/06/25/goodyear&#95;families&#95;settle&#95;miss&#95;crash&#95;lawsuit/" target="&#95;blank">lawsuit</a> for negligence as a result of an athletic activity. The release operates prospectively such that it will bar a future claim. At the end of a case, another type of release is used, and that is the acknowledgement of the receipt of a sum of money in a settlement in return for a release of all claims. You will note that it is appropriate to use the term &#8220;release&#8221; in both contexts despite the term having very different implications for the person who sues. </p><p>What does the release which arises as the result of a settlement mean? It ends a case against that defendant regardless of what may occur with respect to the <a title="Boston Personal Injuries" href="http://www.feinbergalban.com/practice-areas/Personal-Injury/" target="&#95;blank">injuries</a>. In other words, even if the injury worsens such that surgery is necessitated, the person releasing, the releasor, acknowledges that this is &quot;a full and final release&#8221; of all claims and its purpose is to preclude forever any additional claims. This acknowledgement recognizes that any further medical treatment is the burden of the releasor. </p>Two recent blogs dealt with the issue of settling one claim against one of several defendants. The release of all claims as against one defendant will not stop the person from proceeding against the additional defendants. Two caveats should be considered: it is wise to have the release explicitly reference the fact that the case will proceed against the additional defendant(s) and, secondly, all tactical considerations should be considered in resolving a case against one but not all of the defendants.<!--more-->Law firm of Feinberg &amp; Alban, experienced in handling cases related to <a title="Injury Lawsuit in Boston" href="http://www.feinbergalban.com/" target="&#95;blank">injury lawsuit in Boston</a>, discusses various implications of a release from a legal perspective...'

Bozic, MD, an orthopaedic surgeon and vice chairman of orthopaedics at the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center, who has studied revision rates in hip replacement.</p><p>&quot;It was a design failure that frankly wasn&#8217;t picked up until they were implanted in thousands of patients,&quot; Dr. Bozic says. </p><p>&quot;This really underscores the need to track outcomes in hip and knee replacement patients. We happen to be one of the only developed countries in the world that doesn\'t track joint replacements through a patient registry,&quot; he adds.</p><p>Most people who replace a hip or knee can expect their new implants to last for the rest of their lives. </p><p>But in some cases, usually because of loosening, when the components detach from the bone, infection or dislocation, implants have to be removed and replaced in a revision surgery. </p><p>Revisions are more complicated and costly than primary joint replacements because surgeons have less bone and more scar tissue to work with.</p><p>Signs that the implant may be failing include pain and difficulty walking.</p><p>But the company is advising people who know they have ASR implants to schedule follow-up appointments with their surgeons, whether or not they are experiencing problems. </p><p>Doctors will evaluate how the implants are functioning and may give patients blood tests to check for signs of microscopic metal particles around the implant, a sign of abnormal wear. </p><p>Dr. Bozic says the important thing for consumers to remember is that most implants, even the ones affected by this recall, function well and are safe.</p><p>But he acknowledges that this recall has already generated a lot of anxiety among people with hip replacements: &quot;A recall is a huge deal.&quot;</p><p>He says his practice has already operated on people who have not been having trouble with their ASR implants, but who wanted to get them removed for fear of future problems.</p><p /><!--more-->California Personal Injury Lawyers in the Fresno area handling personal injury and product liability cases.&#160;'

aS'<p>With apologies to godaddy.com, do you know who owns your business&#8217;s website and domain name?   In this digital age, more and more of your business&#8217; assets are of the digital variety.  In addition to a website and domain name, your business probably has e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn accounts, just to name a few.  And while the law in terms of ownership of digital assets is new and constantly evolving, who &#8220;owns&#8221; such digital assets and other intangible &#8220;intellectual&#8221; property (such as names, logos, slogans, proprietary processes, marketing materials, etc.)  must be considered in order to fully protect some of your business&#8217;s most valuable assets.</p><p>While at first blush this might seem obvious, the present state of the law is generally that such assets are owned by the individual that created them, rather than the company itself.  This can create some obvious business succession planning  issues if, for example the IT guy&#8221; who  registered the company&#8217;s domain and created the website is terminated.   Or if that creative  employee in marketing who came up with the company&#8217;s logo or slogan dies.   Whose website/logo/slogan is it?  Will your company have the continued right to use it?  These are just a couple examples; the same holds true for other digital assets and intellectual property.</p><p>The United States Patent and Trademark Office has an on-line assessment tool you can take to determine if your business has any intellectual property that needs to be assigned to the company and if any further steps are needed to protect it: <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/inventors/assessment/">http://www.uspto.gov/inventors/assessment/</a></p><p>We recommend that you use this simple tool to determine if any of your business&#8217;s assets are at risk.

aS'On November 1, I blogged on divorce insurance, which provides benefits \r\nto people when they divorce.&#160; Now, we have lending for attorneys fees to\r\n pursue a divorce.&#160; The <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>ABA Journal,</i> \r\nand others are reporting on a new Beverly Hills lender that offers money\r\n for attorneys fees in divorce in exchange for a percentage of the take \r\nafter the divorce.&#160; The company is called Balance Point and is run by \r\nStacey Napp, a lawyer who created the company after struggling for many \r\nyears with her own divorce.&#160; Balance Point caters primarily to females \r\nin cases where the marital estate is between $2 million and $15 million \r\nin net worth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAttorneys fees to pursue divorce is a real problem in most states and \r\ncertainly in Mississippi. If one spouse, (typically the man), controls \r\nthe money, he can use his superior financial power to &#8220;out lawyer&#8221; the \r\nother spouse and force capitulation and perhaps settlement on unfair \r\nterms. Mississippi law seems to allow for the award of attorneys fees on\r\n a temporary basis, but few, if any, Judges allow such awards. Many \r\nJudges may feel that since they have no power to divide property until \r\nthere is a divorce that they cannot make an award of attorneys fees to a\r\n spouse before the divorce. I have long espoused the belief that Judges \r\nshould take control of cases early and determine the issues and their \r\nlegitimacy, and perhaps award fees to the non-moneyed spouse to make \r\nsure they have equal representation.&#160; Without such temporary awards, \r\nfinancing of attorneys fees would certainly provide relief, but not many\r\n people would meet the Beverly Hills criteria of Balance Point.'

aS'<p>Probate in California is defined as legally settling the deceased&#8217;s property, which is referred to as their estate.</p><p>If a will has been drafted, it names an executor of the estate. The executor then contacts a probate attorney in the county were the person was a resident. Once the will is admitted to probate, the executor is responsible for carrying out the decedent&#8217;s written instructions and completing the probate process.</p><p>The California probate process generally includes the following stages to ensure that debts are paid and assets are properly transferred: Heirs and beneficiaries are notified of the proceedings and the petition for appointment of the personal representative. Next, the personal representative (or executor or administrator) is appointed by the court. After that, all creditors are given the opportunity to file claims against the estate and the property is inventoried. Finally, once the probate court is satisfied that all procedures have been properly followed, the court issues an order establishing how the estate must be distributed. A full probate will take a minimum of six months and all filings are part of the public record.</p><p>Certain possessions and property are not subject to probate proceedings. For example, a life insurance policy payout can be paid to a beneficiary designated on the policy without being approved by the probate court. Other types of possessions and property that do not go through probate include: anything that is held in joint tenancy, community property or is titled as &#8220;payable upon death&#8221;.</p><p>California residents who have assets with a gross value of more than $100,000 that are not held in a trust or as stated above will need to go through the probate process. This amount includes the gross value of their real estate assets. So, a $250,000 house with a<br />$249,000 mortgage is counted as having a gross value of $250,000!.</p><p>Your <a href="http://www.generationsprobate.com/">Sacramento estate planning attorney</a> can help you decide if a will or a trust is the proper instrument for you and your family.</p><!--more--><p>Your <a href="http://www.generationsprobate.com/">Sacramento estate planning attorney</a> can help you decide if a will or a trust is the proper instrument for you and your family.</p>'

aS'<p>Have you gifted real estate worth more than $13,000 to a family member?  If so, don&#8217;t forget to file a gift tax return.</p><p>A recent <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304066504576345672097256428.html" target="&#95;blank">Wall Street Journal article </a>discusses the IRS&#8217;s &#8220;low profile, but sweeping&#8221; effort to discover unreported gifts of real estate to family members through an examination of state land-transfer records.  What does that mean?  It means that the IRS is looking at real estate deeds that show transfers of property between family members.  When they find one, they look to IRS records to see if the person who gifted the property filed a gift tax return.  If the IRS doesn&#8217;t find one in their records, they&#8217;ll probably send you a letter, which isn&#8217;t on most people&#8217;s list of favorite things to find in the mailbox. </p><p>So how do you avoid this letter?  Simple.  You file a gift tax return <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f709.pdf" target="&#95;blank">(IRS Form 709) </a>in any year that you gift more than $13,000 to any one person.  That $13,000 amount that passes tax-free is known as your annual exclusion.  If you are married, spouses may combine their annual exclusions and gift up to $26,000 to any one person in any one year before they must file a gift tax return.  That means that Harry and Wendy, as husband and wife, could gift up to $26,000 of real estate to their son, Ralph, without having to report the gift to the IRS.  However, if Harry and Wendy gift real estate worth more than $26,000 to Ralph, they must report the amount of the  gift over and above $26,000 to the IRS on a gift tax return.</p><p>Now, most people&#8217;s next concern is whether they have to pay a tax.  Going back to Harry and Wendy, whether they will pay a gift tax on the amount above $26,000 depends on another type of tax exemption known as the lifetime gift tax exemption.  The lifetime exemption looks at the total amount of gifts that you have made over the course of your lifetime.  While every year you can gift up to $13,000 to any one person tax free because of your annual exclusion, the amounts OVER $13,000 are accumulated over your lifetime and applied to your lifetime exemption.  Your lifetime exemption is $5 million, meaning that once your total lifetime gifts exceed $5 million, then you will start to pay a gift tax on your gifts.  The amount of $5 million comes from recently passed legislation that made significant changes to the gift and estate tax laws, which you can read about in further detail <a href="http://www.einhornharris.com/files/Estate%20Tax%20Changes%20-%20A%20Planning%20Opportunity.pdf" target="&#95;blank">here</a>.</p><p>&#160;As an example, we&#8217;ll go back to Harry and Wendy.  Let&#8217;s say they gift real estate worth $1,000,000 to their son, Ralph.  They must report the gift to the IRS on a federal gift tax return that year because it exceeds $26,000 but they do not have to pay tax at that time. </p><p>On each of their returns, Harry and Wendy would &#8220;split&#8221; the gift, meaning that the IRS will view Harry as giving $500,000 and Wendy as giving $500,000.  So on Harry&#8217;s return, he will report a gift of $487,000 (the $500,000 gift minus the $13,000 annual exclusion).  That $487,000 gift will reduce his $5 million lifetime exemption to $4.513 million, meaning that after this gift Harry can make $4.513 million of gifts before he has to pay a gift tax.  He will not pay a gift tax until he uses that entire amount.    </p><p>If you should have filed a gift tax return in a previous year, but failed to do so, you can file a late return.  However, the lifetime exemption applicable to your gift will be the exemption that was in place during the year the gift was made.  If you gifted over that amount, you will likely owe a gift tax.</p><p>If you are planning to gift real estate worth more than $13,000 to a family member in the future, you should speak with an attorney before making the gift.  Not only will your attorney assist you with properly reporting the gift, but he or she will discuss certain gifting techniques with you that may help you reduce any gift tax that may be due.  Upcoming entries on this blog will also discuss some of these techniques.

This is helpful even if the negligent Third Party entity who is responsible for the injury will be ultimately covering the medical bills. <br /><br />With few exceptions the responsible party/insurance company will not be making any payments until the case comes to resolution. Consequently, having one&#8217;s own medical coverage permits a greater latitude in getting medical care and having a range of choices when it comes to medical providers for your injuries. Without personal insurance the accident or injury victim must rely on their personal injury attorney to find doctors in the appropriate medical specialties, in a convenient locale, to undergo treatment for their accident related injuries. From time to time it is difficult to source such a health care provider, particularly if the personal injury victim is in need of surgery.<br /><br />The most typical types of insurance that the <a href="http://www.san-diego-injury-attorney.com/">personal injury attorney in San Diego</a> sees is either work related health insurance, and/or the medical payments benefits under the injury victims own personal car insurance policy(if we\'re discussing a car accident related injury). In the case of health insurance, the money that is paid out to settle the medical bills of the accident victim are typically reimbursable out of the proceeds of the 3rd party personal injury settlement or award. This prevents the personal injury victim from a double recovery, i.e. getting both the bills paid and the money for the bills. Obviously if there is no personal injury monies paid out by the negligent party then there is no duty to reimburse the health insurance for what they have paid out.<br /><br />Often time\'s car owners have <a href="http://www.san-diego-injury-attorney.com/blogpost30&#95;Medical&#95;Payments&#95;Coverage&#95;Med&#95;Pay&#95;Benefits&#95;.html">medical payments benefits </a>(commonly called &quot;med-pay&quot;) under their automobile insurance policy. This requires the car insurance company to pay reasonable and necessary medical bills for any of the injured occupants of the car up to the predesignated limits of the med-pay. In the past, many insurance companies did not have reimbursement clauses in their car insurance policies. Today most, but not all, car insurers have the right, per their contract of insurance, to reimbursement of monies paid out by them from the proceeds of the injury victims 3rd party settlement/award.<br /><br />Typically the money that is subject to reimbursement is reduced by the same percentage as the injury victim paid for attorney\'s fees. Sometimes the personal injury attorney can negotiate a greater reduction in the reimbursement amount. It is important to consider the reimbursement issue when calculating the net settlement that will be received by the personal injury client. An experienced personal injury lawyer can best advise his client on all matters surrounding insurance issues and the reimbursement issue.<p /></p><!--more-->If one suffers personal injury, whether it is in a car accident, slip and fall accident, or some other type of incident it is extremely beneficial if the accident/injury victim has their own health insurance coverage.

aS'<br /><p>It is possible to take all the right steps to ensure that your attorney gets good results for your case, only to defeat your cause with ill-timed words or actions. Here is a list of precautions you should take to ensure that you do not lose the compensation you deserve for your auto accident:</p><ul><li><b>Do not delay seeking medical treatment.</b> A victim of an auto accident may do this under the mistaken belief that the case needs to be settled before a doctor can be seen. Nothing could be further from the truth&#8212;or more damaging to your health. In fact, healthcare records often provide key documentation needed to build evidence that supports your claim. Therefore, be sure to seek any treatment you need in a timely manner, and keep your&#160;attorney updated on your health status.</li><li><b>Do not share more information than you need to with anyone except your&#160;attorney.</b> Do not tell insurance companies anything other than that you have been in an accident, and are seeking both medical and legal counsel. No matter what they say or do, they cannot force you tell them anything more without your attorney present. Do not admit fault for all or any part of the accident.</li><li><b>Do not accept so-called deals from insurance companies.</b> Insurance companies know how to tempt you with offers of quick and easy settlements. Often, these settlements serve their own best interests and not yours. Once you accept and sign their offer, it can be difficult to retract your consent and attain fairer compensation for your injury.</li></ul><p>It would be impossible to list everything you might do that could jeopardize the case for your auto accident.

aS'<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As everyone knows, some lawyers spend a lot of time and money advertising on television, in phone books, on billboards, and in other media as well. &#160;Recently, the Indiana Supreme Court has made changes to the Indiana Rules of Professional Conduct that will impact how some lawyers market their practices.&#160;&#160; Specifically, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/judiciary/supreme/">Indiana Supreme Court</a> has issued <a href="http://www.in.gov/judiciary/press/2010/1015.html">new rules of professional conduct</a> (the changes may be read in their entirety <a href="http://www.in.gov/judiciary/orders/rule-amendments/2010/prof-conduct-1014.pdf">here</a>) which go into effect January 1, 2011.&#160; One of the new rules is that attorneys must wait <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/sns-bc-in--accidents-lawyers,0,4156775.story">30 days</a> before contacting potential clients with a solicitation of any kind.&#160; Accident victims are still free to contact an attorney at any time.&#160; This is a form of advertising that Greene &amp; Schultz has <i>never</i> engaged in.&#160; However, it is lawful and will now simply have some minimal regulations placed on it.&#160; </p><p TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Unless you have been in a car accident in the last seven to ten years, you may not even be aware that this practice has been going on.&#160; &#160;This type of marketing is what is known as &#8220;Direct Mail&#8221; and works something like this: Police reports from car accidents are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public&#95;records">public records</a>.&#160; Lawyers with active Direct Mail marketing campaigns then purchase copies of police reports and send advertising solicitations in the mail to the person who was not &#8220;at fault,&#8221; hoping to sign them up as clients.&#160; I&#8217;ve seen many of these solicitations, and they range from one page letters with a refrigerator magnet included, to high gloss multi-page brochures.&#160; Some even include videos or DVDs.&#160; Most of the material is quite professional and would be something a person might expect to receive after they had already retained a lawyer&#8217;s services, or had the person initiated the contact with the law firm(s).</p><p TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Over the last seven years, this practice has grown to the point where people who are involved in accidents get ten to fifteen packets in the mail from different lawyers.&#160; Clients of mine frequently marvel that they would get so much mail from lawyers just two or three days after the wreck that they couldn&#8217;t get it all out of their mailboxes.&#160; This form of advertising is effective because it is a direct solicitation aimed at a specific group of people who have a significantly higher probability of needing or considering legal assistance than the general public.&#160; However, while it is effective, it is also highly objectionable to many people who are the unsuspecting recipients of these solicitations.</p><p TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">At Greene &amp; Schultz, we try to make very thoughtful advertising decisions that weigh both the effectiveness of our marketing with how we think we will be perceived by the public.&#160; If we believe the public will perceive us to be &#8220;just another ambulance chaser&#8221; then we will choose not to advertise in that particular manner.&#160; Some of you may have even heard our office&#8217;s advertisements on the radio and our sponsorships of <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> or <a href="http://www.pbs.org/">PBS</a>.&#160; Advertising professionals sometimes refer to the overall effort of a business to market their firm as &#8220;branding.&#8221;&#160; It&#8217;s no surprise that Betsy and I hope the Greene &amp; Schultz &#8220;brand&#8221; with the public stands for our core beliefs of being excellent trial lawyers who fight for our clients against giant insurance companies, not ambulance chasers who are only interested in making a fast buck.</p><p TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">There is certainly nothing wrong with advertising one&#8217;s business and I am not insinuating that lawyers who advertise in ways that our firm doesn&#8217;t are somehow doing something ethically wrong.&#160; I don&#8217;t believe that to be the case.&#160; Most people forget that before he was the 16<sup>th</sup> President of the United States, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham&#95;Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> was a trial lawyer from Illinois, who advertised for clients in a local newspaper.&#160; Really, advertising boils down to a matter of taste and a person&#8217;s preference in how they wish to be perceived.&#160; I am a firm believer that when it comes to advertising, the old adage &#8220;you get what you ask for&#8221; is very applicable.</p><p TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Having said all this, there are a few reasons why I believe law firms should not engage in direct mail solicitations, or why I believe the new Rule of Professional Conduct restricting the practice and adding a 30-day waiting period is a good idea.&#160; First, it is simply my belief that this type of advertising is inappropriate because it is much more intentional and personal than radio, television, internet, or phone book.&#160; An injured person or family who has lost a loved one is receiving a packet of information in their mailbox addressed to them from a law firm they did not initiate contact with.&#160; I have had clients tell me that they were &#8220;disgusted,&#8221;&#160; &#8220;offended,&#8221; etc.&#160; One client who lost her son in an accident told me that it did not escape her notice that the law firm sending the packet in the mail to her did so on the day of her son&#8217;s funeral. This not only hurts the image of the law firm sending the direct solicitation, it hurts the image of the legal profession.</p><p TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Second, the law firms that send direct mail don&#8217;t know who has been injured and who has not.&#160; Therefore, they send solicitations to many people who aren&#8217;t even injured.&#160; My guess is that well over half the people who receive these solicitations aren&#8217;t even hurt.&#160; Again, this tarnishes the profession because all of these uninjured people tell their friends about receiving packets in the mail from lawyers &#8220;and I wasn&#8217;t even hurt.&#8221;&#160; It makes all of us look like ambulance chasers.&#160; Even worse, it creates a ready-made audience for calls for &#8220;tort reform.&#8221; When non-injured people receive these direct solicitations, it feeds the myth that the <a href="http://www.uschamber.com/legalreform">United States Chamber of Commerce</a> is trying to sell that there are &#8220;too many frivolous lawsuits&#8221; or that &#8220;trial lawyers are wrecking our economy.&#8221;&#160; Enemies of the Civil Justice System are then emboldened to try to restrict an injured person&#8217;s access to the courthouse, and the direct mail solicitations by lawyers are &#8220;Exhibit A&#8221; as to why caps on damages or other &#8220;tort reform&#8221; ideas should be passed into law.</p><p TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Opponents to the new rule change argue that insurance adjusters or defense attorneys are not barred from making contact with victims, and this point has been a matter of much debate in <a href="http://www.theindychannel.com/news/25402881/detail.html">public discussion forums</a>.&#160; However, the rule also does not prevent injured parties from contacting a lawyer once they realize that they are dealing with an insurance company that does not have the injured party&#8217;s best interest at heart. In fact, it has been my experience that direct contact by an insurance adjuster who is &#8220;investigating&#8221; the claim makes an injured person realize they need help from a lawyer. </p><p TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Incidentally, Indiana attorneys who do not follow our state&#8217;s <a href="http://www.in.gov/judiciary/rules/prof&#95;conduct/index.html">Rules of Professional Conduct</a> can be charged with misconduct. The Indiana Supreme Court has final authority over attorney discipline.

aS'<p>What the statistics say about big rig accidents is not at all comforting; in fact these statistics show that twelve percent of all traffic fatality accidents involve a big rig. To add to this four percent of traffic injures involve a big rig. The statistics also show that seventy-seven percent of injured big rig accident injury victims and eighty-six of the fatalities were drivers in a non-commercial vehicle. </p><p>On the other side of these statistics it shows that in even the most serious passenger vehicle and big rig collision the truck driver will in most cases walk away uninjured. The reason for the accident can vary, since each accident is different, but in some cases it is because the truck was unsafe.\r\n \r\nWhat the statistics say about big rig accidents is not good for the person that is in a vehicle, because the injuries for the victims that are not fatally injured are severe. </p><p>The big rig is vehicle that can weigh as much as 40,000 pounds or more if fully loaded and the average car weights about 4,000 pounds. That is a large difference when they collide. The built-in protection measures on the vehicle are no match for this kind of weight smashing into it. This type of big rig accident can happen on any highway and that includes the freeways of San Francisco. The injuries can be extremely severe, like spinal cord injuries that will be a lifetime injury. </p><p>Seatbelts and airbags will not be very helpful when matched against the metal of a big rig. The severe injuries can mean being hospitalized, surgeries, rehabilitation, professional home nursing care and other financial difficulties. This is because with severe injuries there is loss of work and in some cases the injured victim cannot go back to their employment for an extended amount of time or permanently.  \r\n</p><p>While there is little defense against injury when involved in a big rig crash the one avenue the injured victim does have after the accident is to hold the big rig driver and the company that owns the truck in many cases.

In a first degree offense, the defendant has been convicted of a crime such as a 1st offense DUI, petit theft, identity theft, or criminal mischief over $200. The maximum fine for a 1st degree misdemeanor is $1,000, and may require up to one year in jail.

The types of injuries are as varied as the types of accidents, which include slip and fall accidents, injuries caused by defective products, medical malpractice, and a seemingly endless list of other accidents. But with nearly three million people injured each year in U.S. motor vehicle crashes, these may be the most common accidental injuries.&#160; </p><p class="WebHeading2"><strong>The most typical injuries range from moderate to severe</strong></p><p class="WebText">Not all accidental injuries are severe.&#160; Many will heal completely over time.&#160; But not all accident victims are this fortunate. Depending on the type of injury, many victims can expect their lives&#8212;and the lives of their families&#8212;to change dramatically. The following are some of the most common types of accidental injuries:</p><ul><li><div class="WebBulletList"><b>Fractures.</b> Most fractures occur to the upper and lower limbs, and many are treatable with splints and casts, followed by therapy. However, surgery may be required, particularly for serious hip and knee injuries. While these injuries are common in auto accidents, they are also common in slip and fall and construction site accidents, as well.</div></li><li><div class="WebBulletList"><b>Back injuries.</b> The wrenching motion of a collision is a common cause of back injuries, but any type of fall can cause such injury as well. In the best cases, treatment involves pain medication and physical therapy, but surgery may be required in certain cases.</div></li><li><div class="WebBulletList"><b>Head and neck injuries.</b> While brain injuries are more common in side-impact accidents, neck injuries such as whiplash occur more frequently in rear-end collisions.&#160; And car accidents are not the only cause of head injuries. Head injuries can be the result of slip and fall accidents, and can be common in construction site accidents. In most cases, whiplash heals over an extended period, but it can leave victims with chronic pain. Head injuries may involve traumatic brain injury (TBI), which can lead to temporary or permanent brain function impairment.</div></li><li><div class="WebBulletList"><b>Spinal cord injury.</b> According to <a href="http://www.brainandspinalcord.org/media-center/FactsAboutSCI.html" target="&#95;blank">BrainandSpinalCord.org</a>, about 11,000 new cases of spinal cord injury occur each year, with the majority caused by motor vehicle accidents, slips and falls, and sports or recreation activities.

aS'Interest in our SmartKits has been high in the last few months since we introduced it, and in response to comments we&#8217;ve added a couple items like a handy list of emergency numbers you can use in case of an accident.<br /><br />The SmartKit contains first aid supplies and bandages, an emergency display banner to notify other drivers of the accident, and a flashlight and battery. There also are everyday items you might use, such as a tire gauge and a pocket-size road atlas. All of this comes in a container that will fit perfectly into your glove box or storage bin.<br /><br />We put the SmartKit together to help our clients and others be prepared in case of an accident. At a time of confusion and stress, it&#8217;s good to have at your fingertips certain things that can help guide you through the time following a crash. Information you can gather at the scene could be helpful for us, and could have an impact on the successful outcome of a legal case.<br /><br />The SmartKit provides you with simple step-by-step instructions, along with other resources you&#8217;ll find useful &#8211; for example, a form for getting the name and contact information of the other driver, their insurance information, the name of the police officer who investigates and a few basic facts about how the accident happened.<br /><br />I hope you never need to use the kit, but I&#8217;d like you to have one just the same.

aS'<p><strong>Terms of Service: Why are they important to have on your website?</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>Terms\r\n of service, also called acceptable use policies, are the Internet \r\nequivalent of the fine print, the document that dictates the conditions \r\nthat apply in order for an individual to use a website or a network. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen was the last time you read the terms of service for any of the \r\nwebsites or networks you join? Perhaps that question should be \r\nrephrased: have you ever read the terms of service for any of the \r\nwebsites or networks you join? It\'s so much easier to avoid the \r\nonslaught of verbiage, densely populated with legal terms and \r\nsemi-colons; to cut to the chase and just click on that little box \r\nbesides the words, &quot;I agree.&quot; <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut by clicking on that little box, you may be binding yourself to a \r\nlegally enforceable contract, particularly in those cases where the \r\nterms of service are plainly offered for your review. When the plaintiff\r\n in the 2008 case Feldman v. Google Inc alleged that at least 20% of the\r\n clicks for the keywords he purchased using Google\'s AdWords program \r\nwere fraudulent, the defendant countered by pointing to Google\'s terms \r\nof service: in order to activate the service, the defendant had to \r\naccept these terms by clicking in a box alongside the words, &quot;Yes, I \r\nagree to the above terms and conditions.&quot; The United States District \r\nCourt of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania found for the defendant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf particular interest in this case is the fact that the court did not \r\nrequire the defendant to have read the terms of service, only that he be\r\n given notice that they existed and an opportunity to review them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom an end user\'s point of view, then, it is always a good idea to \r\nfamiliarize oneself with acceptable use policies, particularly when \r\nparticipating in an online service like eBay or PayPal where financial \r\ntransactions routinely occur. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut terms of service are equally critical from a website owner\'s or \r\nservice provider\'s perspective: they define guidelines for prospective \r\nusers\' normative use, expected standards of behavior and the penalties \r\nusers may face for violating acceptable use. It is always a sound \r\nbusiness practice to limit assumption. Terms of service can cover a wide\r\n variety of issues including online privacy, copyright policies, safety \r\nand account security, interactions with other users, portage to mobile \r\nplatforms, payment terms, developer provisions, provisions pertaining to\r\n international users, advertising protocols, dispute resolution and \r\ngrounds for termination of services. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt\'s a good idea for anyone setting up a website to include an \r\nacceptable use policy. But it\'s absolutely essential for any \r\nbusinessperson who is considering launching an ecommerce site. Although \r\nit may be tempting under these circumstances to log onto one\'s favorite \r\nsite, &quot;borrow&quot; <em>their</em> terms of service and do a little creative \r\ntweaking before publishing them as your own, this is never a good idea. \r\nFor one thing those terms of service are an original work protected \r\nunder copyright, and it\'s copyright infringement to reproduce or make \r\ninto a derivative work copyrighted words without the express permission \r\nof the copyright holder. For another, your website is a unique entity \r\nwith its own unique set of circumstances and requirements: someone \r\nelse\'s terms of service are likely to leave out some of the essential \r\nareas where you need to set ground rules. If you are a businessperson \r\nthinking of setting up a website, you would be well advised to consult \r\nwith an experienced <a href="http://www.aaronkellylaw.com/Attorneys/" target="&#95;blank">Internet attorney</a> about drafting a personalized \r\nacceptable use policy.</p>'

aS'<p>According to the National Center for Health Statistics, there is one divorce for every two marriages since the year 2000. According to the Florida Supreme Court: &quot;The institution of marriage has been a cornerstone of western civilization for thousands of years and is the most important type of contract ever formed.&quot; <u>In</u> <u>re</u> <u>Estate</u> <u>of</u> <u>Yohn</u>, 238 So.2d 290, 296 (Fla. 1970). Clearly, some people do not revere the institution of marriage as much as the courts do.</p><p>Most attorneys encourage their clients to revisit their wills in the event of a subsequent marriage or divorce. This is not just because the attorney wants to make more money, but rather, because the law attaches independent significance to these events which may or may not be consistent with your estate plans.</p><p center" /><p>Consider the typical married couple today. As soon as they get divorced, any provisions in their wills in favor of the divorced spouse become void by operation of law. As soon as they remarry, the law gives them the right to receive a share of their new spouse&#8217;s estate in the absence of a valid marital settlement agreement to the contrary.</p><p>Let&#8217;s say you and your wife have mutual wills which leave everything to each other and then, to the children upon death of the surviving spouse. If you die first and your wife fails to protect the children by entering into a property settlement with her new husband, your children will have to share her estate with the second husband if she dies before he does.</p><p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if the second marriage lasts fifty years or fifty minutes. In the absence of a valid prenuptial or postnuptial agreement to the contrary, the surviving spouse will receive an &quot;elective share&quot; or a &quot;pretermitted spouse&#8217;s share&quot; of the estate.</p><p>The surviving spouse of a person who dies domiciled in Florida is entitled to receive an amount equal to 30% of the fair market value of the &quot;elective estate&quot; after deducting all claims paid or payable from the &quot;elective estate&quot; and all mortgages, liens or other security interests on property included in the &quot;elective estate.&quot; This is called the surviving spouse&#8217;s &quot;elective share.&quot;</p><p>Similarly, when a person marries after making a will and the spouse survives the testator, the surviving spouse is entitled to receive a share of the probate estate as if the person had died intestate (<u>i.e.</u>, had made no will) unless the will was made in contemplation of marriage or some provision was made for or waived by the surviving spouse by prenuptial or postnuptial agreement. This is called the &quot;pretermitted spouse&#8217;s share.&quot;</p><p>Thus, if your wife fails to make a new will after she remarries, her second husband will be entitled to claim 50% of her probate estate, even if her old will left everything to your children. Furthermore, even if she makes a new will after she remarries, her second husband will be entitled to claim his &quot;elective share&quot; (<u>i.e.</u>, 30% of her &quot;elective estate&quot;), <u>against</u> <u>the</u> <u>will</u> in the absence of a valid prenuptial or postnuptial agreement to the contrary.</p><p>Why would anyone choose 30% of the &quot;elective estate&quot; over 50% of the probate estate? Because the &quot;elective estate&quot; includes property that passes outside of probate including, but not limited to, the decedent&#8217;s ownership interest in POD accounts, joint tenancy property, trust accounts, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, pension plans, retirement accounts and even certain property transferred during the 1-year period before death. Nowadays, most people have as much money invested in assets that will pass outside of the probate process but the surviving spouse can count those assets in calculating his or her &quot;elective share&quot; of the &quot;elective estate.&quot;</p><p>In summary, the law will protect your surviving spouse after you die. It&#8217;s up to <u>you</u> to protect your children by planning your estate before you enter into any new marriage contracts.</p><p>&#169; 2013, Astrid de Parry, P.A., 107 East Church Street, DeLand, FL 32724</p>'

For example, Cook County Circuit Court Rule 13.4(a)(i)(h) now states that:&#160; <i>&#8220;At the time of the appointment of an evaluation pursuant to 750 ILCS 5/604, the court may issue a protective order prohibiting the parties or their attorneys from disseminating the contents of said report for purposes other than the litigation or to the minor children or to anyone who is not a party to the litigation.&#8221;</i> &#160;Not only can a protective order be obtained by local rule in Cook County, but it has long been available throughout Illinois upon a proper showing.&#160; <b><u>Skolnick v.

aS'<p>The best advice I can offer regarding a DUI is not to drink alcohol \r\nand then drive a motor vehicle.&#160; Besides risking being prosecuted for a \r\ncriminal offense, driving while impaired can easily result in a serious \r\naccident or death of a person.&#160; Such a situation will likely result in a\r\n prosecution for either an Aggravated Assault or a Manslaughter.&#160; \r\nProsecutors generally seek prison sentences for such crimes.&#160; Few \r\ncircumstances can change a person\'s life faster than causing the death \r\nof another person by driving while impaired.&#160; Many people are unaware \r\nthat driving with an alcohol level below the legal limit can also result\r\n in a prosecution for a DUI.&#160; Even over the counter medications or \r\nprescription medications can be the basis for a DUI charge if those \r\nmedications result in the slightest impairment to a driver.&#160; If you plan\r\n to drink alcohol, take a taxi or use a designated driver.&#160; It is better\r\n than ruining your life or some else\'s life in an instant.</p>\r\n<p>The best thing to do is always remember my number one piece of advice...just Shut up!</p><div overflow: hidden; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;"><p>If you are pulled over by an officer who suspects you may be \r\nimpaired, you should not answer any questions.&#160; You are not ever \r\nrequired to answer questions posed by a police officer.&#160; You are \r\nrequired to present your driver\'s license, vehicle registration and \r\nproof of insurance.&#160; Generally speaking, refusing all tests at the \r\nroadside is the better choice.&#160; Even completely sober drivers can fail \r\nmany of those tests.&#160; In any event, it is the officer who decides how \r\nyou performed on those tests.&#160; You may not agree with the officer\'s \r\nconclusion.&#160; You may be required to exit your vehicle whether you are \r\nthe driver or the passenger.&#160; You should always request to speak to an \r\nattorney immediately.&#160;</p>\r\n<p>Punishments for DUI offenses include mandatory jail, mandatory fines,\r\n counseling, license suspensions, ignition interlock devices and \r\ngenerally cause insurance rates to increase.&#160; Punishments are severely \r\nincreased for multiple DUI convictions.&#160; Committing a DUI while your \r\ndriver\'s license is suspended or revoked for any reason can result in \r\nprosecution for a felony offense.&#160; A felony conviction can haunt you for\r\n the rest of your life.&#160; DUI is an easy crime to avoid.&#160; Adults of legal\r\n age should feel free to drink alcohol, but are required to do so \r\nresponsibly. &#160;Driving after drinking alcohol is not responsible, and can\r\n easily result in dramatically changing your life for the worse in an \r\ninstant.&#160;&#160; In short, don\'t do it. &#160;</p>\r\n<p><strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.attorneyforfreedom.com/">www.AttorneyForFreedom.com</a></strong></p><div overflow: hidden; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;"><br /></div><br /></div>'

Even the person walking that does not cross the street is not safe, there are accidents every year with vehicles that veer off of the road striking the person walking. </p><p>This can be due to the driver going at a high rate of speed, talking on a cell phone or other distractions that make the driver negligent. \r\nUrban areas are not the only place that pedestrian accidents occur that are fatal or cause injuries, there are 14.3 percent of these accidents that occur in rural areas. </p><p>This means even walking in the Riverside neighborhoods is not always safe.

aS'<p>California is one of the most heavily commuting states in United States. Apart from huge numbers of cars on the road, California roads are also a very busy state with bicycles. Here you have biking lanes on almost all public streets, so biking is a highly recommended mode of transportation. </p><p>But the bad news is: about 720 bicyclists got killed in road accidents in the United States; this number is for last year alone and it reports that there was a fatal bicyclist accident for every 6 hours and half of the victims are children that were below 16 years of age. In addition, about 75% of the bicyclist faces serious injuries and fatal accidents, because of head injuries. </p><p>If a road accident involves a motor vehicle and a bicyclist, most of the time a bicyclist can obtain a lower compensation amount from insurance companies than motor vehicle drivers. One of the recent research reports have revealed that compensation for injuries caused in car accidents are 40% higher when compared with cyclists who sustained the same type of injuries, due to a road accident. This is the reason why most of the bicycle accident attorneys recommend the injured bicyclists should file an insurance claim as quickly as possible. In this case, you should approach an experienced attorney, as he will help you to receive the full compensation. </p><p>\r\nIn most of the cases, a bicycle accident takes place, because of the motorist&#8217;s negligence or heedlessness of the bicyclist while riding the bike. </p><p>Here are some common types of hits in which a cyclist may get injuries and need a <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/pages/3440/PracticeAreas&#95;Bicycle-Accidents.htm">Los Angeles bicycle attorney</a>:\r\n</p><p>?\tIf a motorbike driver turns the bike directly in the path of a bicyclist; \r\n</p><p>?\tIf a motorist\'s fail to stop at a stop sign, at an intersection or red light\r\nA vehicle driver\'s inattention is another main reason which leads to bicyclist accident. </p><p>Cycling accidents are different from other accident cases, because they may present strange legal issues. Hill slopes, conditions of the road, lanes and routes, lines of sight, distinctions among bicycle paths, intersection crossings are some of important legal issues, which may be included in a bike accident case. </p><p>So, it is always good to contact a California bicycle attorney who can understand the legalities properly and can further advocate for you. On the other hand, it is also important for the bicyclist to obey the traffic laws.  </p><p>Most of the time, automobile drivers do not compare a bicyclist with a motor vehicle, and it is also a main reason for accidents. So, it is very important for both the drivers whether bicyclist or motor vehicle driver to observe and cooperate with each other.

Officials said over 70\r\nair show spectators were taken to area hospitals to treat major head injuries,\r\nfacial trauma and limb injuries.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p min-height: 14px;"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The\r\nNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation into the cause of the\r\nReno air show crash will center around a piece of the aircraft\'s tail that\r\nwitnesses say came off the plane seconds before crashing into the VIP section.\r\nAmateur videos taken of the crash by spectators show what appears to be a small\r\npiece of the plane plummeting to the ground seconds before the crash. The\r\nbreakaway part suggests a potential mechanical failure on the aircraft, which\r\ncalls into question potential maintenance issues with the 60-year-old plane.\r\nRecords indicate that the plane involved in Friday\'s crash had previously\r\ncrashed almost 40 years ago after an engine failure. Since then, the plane has\r\nhad several engine replacements as well as a new canopy and many other\r\nmodifications. Witnesses believe the part that fell off the tail appeared to be\r\nthe &quot;elevator trim tab,&quot; which is a small surface on the tail used to\r\nstabilize the aircraft. NTSB investigators say the component in question has\r\nbeen recovered from the crash site, but at this time they are hesitant to\r\nconfirm that it is the elevator trim tab from the plane. Elevator trim tabs\r\nfree pilots from having to put constant pressure on pitch controls.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p min-height: 14px;"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another\r\ntheory being discussed is that the pilot seat may have broken or malfunctioned\r\nin a way that caused pilot Jimmy Leeward to lose control of the P-51 Mustang. A\r\npicture taken moments before the plane plummeted into air show spectators shows\r\na cockpit without a pilot, leading some to wonder if the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2039871/Reno-air-crash-2011-Pilots-chair-broken-moments-impact.html">pilot\'s seat broke\r\nfree</a>. A mechanic familiar with planes like the vintage P-51 told news\r\norganizations that even if Leeward had slumped in his seat, he would still be\r\nvisible in the cockpit.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p min-height: 14px;"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investigators\r\nfrom the NTSB will also be looking at the health of 74-year-old stunt pilot\r\nJimmy Leeward. Leeward was flying in the &quot;Unlimited&quot; race, where\r\nplanes typically fly as low as 50 feet in extremely close proximity to one\r\nanother at speeds of over 500 miles per hour. The nature of the <a href="http://www.airplanecrash-lawyer.com/">fatal plane\r\ncrash</a> has bolstered those concerned about air show safety issues. Some are\r\ncalling on race organizers to end the highly dangerous event, which is the only\r\none of its kind in the United States. This marks the first time in the event\'s\r\n47 years that spectators have been killed.&#160; Including Leeward, 20 pilots\r\nhave died flying in the Reno races. The NTSB investigation into the cause of\r\nthe Reno air show tragedy is ongoing. &#160;</p>\r\n\r\n'

aS'Unemployment benefits is a very misunderstood concept--for lack of a better term. As an attorney that focuses on labor and employment law, anytime I get phone calls from people with potential labor or employment law claims, I almost always delve into the topic of unemployment benefits because often times I am dealing with someone who was recently separated from their employment.<br /><br />I first ask whether they are receiving or have applied for unemployment compensation, and, depending on the answer, sometimes I have to probe a little more to determine whether or not they are eligible.<br /><br /><strong>Have Enough Wages Been Earned?</strong><br />In Wisconsin, the calendar year is divided into quarters and the first quarter begins in January. To determine whether you have enough wages to qualify and how much you can be paid, you take the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters before the week you file an initial claim application for a new benefit year. If you do not have enough wages to qualify for a claim using the base period described above, an &quot;alternate base period&quot; will be used. The alternate base period will be the four most recently completed calendar quarters before the week you filed your initial claim application for a new benefit year.<br /><br /><strong>Covered and Excluded Employment</strong><br />Covered employment is work you perform for an employer who is subject to the unemployment insurance law. However, some work is &quot;excluded&quot; (not covered) even when performed for a covered employer. Only wages paid from covered employment can be used to qualify for unemployment benefits and to calculate how much you can be paid. Examples of &quot;excluded&quot; employment are if you work for an educational institution while you are a student there or work as a real estate or insurance salesperson if paid only by commission.<br /><br /><strong>Qualifying Wages</strong><br />To qualify for unemployment benefits you must have been paid wages from covered employment in at least two quarters of your base period. You need:<br /><br />?Enough wages in your high quarter to qualify for the minimum <a href="http://www.dwd.state.wi.us/uiben/calculator&#95;wbr.htm">Weekly Benefit Rate</a> (&quot;WBR&quot;);<br />?Wages in your 3 lowest quarters that equal at least 4 times your WBR when added together;<br />?Total base period wages equal to at least 35 times your WBR; and<br />?If you were paid benefits in a prior benefit year which has ended, you must have worked since the beginning of that benefit year and earned at least 8 times the WBR of that claim.<br />Your base period wages will not automatically include monies you may have authorized with-held as part of a cafeteria or similar plan. You may request that these monies be added to your base period wages by calling a claims specialist.<br /><br />There is a lot more that goes into computing benefits that are beyond the scope of this article and most telephone conversations with potential clients. After it appears the person has earned enough wages, I then ask them how the separation occurred--i.e., were they terminated or did they quit. The burden lies with the party that caused the separation from employment.<br /><br /><strong>Common Disqualifications from Benefits</strong><br />Most people I encounter almost always have severe misconceptions of whether they are eligible for unemployment benefits. People who are terminated think that just because they are terminated that they are automatically ineligible and people who quit think that just because they quit that are automatically ineligible for benefits.<br /><br /><strong>If You Are Terminated</strong> <strong>Employer Must Show &quot;Misconduct&quot;</strong><br />Whenever I encounter a person who was terminated from their employment, I explain to them that, because it was the employer who caused the separation from employment, it is <em>their</em> burden to show that they engaged in &quot;misconduct connected to their employment.&quot; Misconduct is a legal term that isn\'t defined by statute but was defined by the Court in <em>Boynton Cab v. Neubeck</em>, 237 Wis. 249, 296 N.W. 636 (1941):<br /><br />&quot;. . . the intended meaning of the term \'misconduct\' . . . is limited to conduct evincing such willful or wanton disregard of an employer\'s interests as is found in deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of his employee, or in carelessness or negligence of such degree or recurrence as to manifest equal culpability, wrongful intent or evil design, or to show an intentional and substantial disregard of the employer\'s interests or of the employee\'s duties and obligations to his employer. On the other hand mere inefficiency, unsatisfactory conduct, failure in good performance as the result of inability or incapacity, inadvertencies or ordinary negligence in isolated instances, or good-faith errors in judgment or discretion are not to be deemed \'misconduct\' within the meaning of the statute.&quot;<br /><br />So, believe it or not, a garbage truck driver who gets into three accidents at no fault of his own, <em>should</em> be eligible for unemployment benefits because the accidents were not &quot;misconduct&quot;--they were not willful or in wanton disregard, but merely accidents.<br /><br /><strong>If You Quit Your Employment, You Must Show Good Cause</strong><br />It is usually a lot more difficult for someone to be eligible for unemployment benefits when they quit because then the burden is on them to show that they quit for &quot;good cause.&quot; Good cause is another term not defined by statute and held to be a broad and subjective concept and involves an assessment of the reasonableness of the employer\'s conduct and of the employee\'s response.<br /><br />There are a number of other reasons one may be disqualified for unemployment benefits, but these are often the main mistaken concepts I encounter as a practitioner.<!--more-->Overview of unemployment compensation in Wisconsin.'

aS'<p><b>RECENT FLIGHT ATTENDANT MELTDOWN&#160; - <a href="http://www.greeneschultz.com/practice-areas/">Indiana accidents</a></b></p><p><b>BOTH FUNNY &#8211; AND NOT SO FUNNY</b></p><p /><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I think we all laughed at the recent news that flight attendant Steve Slater had had enough, cussed out a passenger, grabbed a couple beers, and headed for the emergency slide. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all wanted to do something similar at our own job, or at some point in our life.&#160; However, after reflecting on this incident for a bit, it made me stop and consider whether our airline industry is pushing itself, and its employees, to the breaking point.&#160; This is a serious question, not a laughing matter.Roles in emergencies</p><p>According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, &#8220;[a]lthough the primary job of the flight attendants is to ensure that security and safety regulations are followed, attendants also try to make flights comfortable and enjoyable for passengers.&#8221; [<a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos171.htm">BLS</a>].&#160; On a typical flight, your flight attendant will not have to call on his or her emergency response training, but safety and security are always of a higher priority than creature comforts.&#160; In fact, effective December 11, 2004, no person may serve as a flight attendant aboard an aircraft of an air carrier unless that person holds a Certificate Of Demonstrated Proficiency issued by the FAA [<a href="http://www.faa.gov/other&#95;visit/aviation&#95;industry/airline&#95;operators/airline&#95;safety/info/all&#95;infos/media/2008/info08016.pdf">FAA Notice</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/49/usc&#95;sec&#95;49&#95;00044728----000-.html">US Code</a>].</p><p /><p /><p /><p>Actions of flight attendants in emergencies have long been credited in saving lives.&#160; In the United States, the <a title="National Transportation Safety Board" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National&#95;Transportation&#95;Safety&#95;Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> (NTSB) and other aviation authorities view flight attendants as essential for safety, and are thus required on <a title="Part 121 (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Part&#95;121&action=edit&redlink=1">Part 121</a> aircraft operations.

aS'<p>If the spouses have not signed a prenuptial agreement, they are considered to be living in a matrimonial property regime of joint ownership of accumulated assets as determined by statute.</p><p>GRP Rainer Lawyers and Tax Advisors in Cologne, Berlin, Bonn, Bremen, Dusseldorf, Essen, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich, Nuremberg, Stuttgart and London www.grprainer.com/en conclude: If the joint ownership of accumulated assets comes to an end, an equitable distribution of martial property must take place according to the provisions of the German Civil Code (BGB). The gain in assets is calculated to be the value amount of the final assets of the spouses which exceeds the initial value of assets held. The gain, in any case, is represented as a sum amount of money. The sum cannot be negative, and if the calculation of such a gain should be determined to be a negative amount, then a zero should be applied. Such a calculation is completed by using accounting entries of accounts.<br /><br />The initial assets of the spouses is taken to be those assets which the spouses held upon commencement of the matrimonial property regime of joint ownership of accumulated assets which usually means on the day of marriage. Existing liabilities of the spouses are to be withdrawn from these initial assets.<br /><br />The amount of final assets is taken to be the amount that remains after deducting existing liabilities of the spouses upon termination of the matrimonial property regime.<br /><br />As a rule, an equitable distribution must ultimately be determined for the spouse which achieved the lesser asset value during the marriage. Generally, half of the profit of the gain of assets from the other spouse having achieved a higher level of gained assets is due to the spouse having achieved a lower level of gained assets as a compensation claim which tends to be an amount of money. A surplus is calculated by subtracting the lower from the higher added value. The amount of the claim for the equitable distribution of assets is calculated by taking half of the accumulated gain.<br /><br />It is, however, to be determined freely between the spouses even in the context of divorce proceedings by the conclusion of agreements on equitable distribution of asset gains. These are then required to be notarized or to be recorded by the family court.<br /><br />In the run-up to the marriage or during the time of marriage, corresponding agreements as to the amount of the equitable distribution can be concluded by the spouses, for example, as a prenuptial agreement or divorce settlement.<br /><br />A lawyer can help to establish the appropriate asset balance sheets, to calculate the equitable distribution or to make arrangements in advance with regard to the equitable distribution of a gain in assets.<br /><br />http://www.grprainer.com/en/Surplus-Equalization.html</p>'

aS'<p class="MsoNormal">Given the increased permissibility and&#160;accessibility of marijuana throughout Colorado, questions have been raised regarding the impact of marijuana use on&#160;driving performance and the risk of motor vehicle collisions.&#160; While scientific research on this issue has gained momentum in recent years, the results are clouded by inconsistent findings and methodologies.&#160; Some researchers believe marijuana has a minimal effect on psychomotor skills. Others have concluded drivers who tested positive for marijuana within several hours of use were more than twice as likely to be involved in a motor vehicle accident.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, this topic is no longer just academic in nature.&#160;&#160;In 2013, voters in Colorado approved Amendment 64, making it legal for anyone over the age of 21 to use or possess marijuana for any purpose.&#160;&#160;While the law did not make it legal for people to smoke pot and get behind the wheel, many users continue to do so.&#160;&#160;The 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) revealed an estimated 10.3 million adults (3.9 percent) reported driving under the influence of illicit drugs the year prior.&#160;&#160;According to the National Highway Safety Administration&#8217;s (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) census, 3,952 fatally injured drivers tested positive for drug involvement in 2009.</p><p class="MsoNormal">As an&#160;<a  rel="nofollow" href="www.coloradopersonalinjuryhelp.com">experienced personal injury attorney</a>&#160;in Denver, I cannot stress enough the importance of using the newly legalized drug in a safe manner.&#160;&#160;Users have to understand the negative consequences associated with driving under the influence of marijuana including short-term memory, hand-eye coordination, concentration, and perception of time and distance.

Mooney, Associate, Eichelbaum Wardell Hansen\r\nPowell &amp; Mehl, P.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">Now that the school\r\nyear is back in full swing, it is time for schools to review the &#8220;old&#8221; law and\r\nfamiliarize themselves with the new developments in the issue that every\r\ndistrict faces: student attendance.&#160; Of\r\ncourse, it is every school&#8217;s goal that students be consistently present at\r\nschool so that each may meet his or her own individual educational goals and\r\nbenchmarks.&#160; Moreover, with the\r\nadditional pressures placed on schools, including maintaining the average daily\r\nattendance and meeting accountability testing standards, it has become all the more\r\ncritical that every student attend class on every school calendar day.&#160; Unfortunately, sometimes the only way to\r\nresolve the issue of an excessively absent student is to file truancy\r\ncharges.&#160; </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><b>&#160;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 6pt;"><b>&#8220;Parent\r\nContributing to Nonattendance&#8221;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">As a review,\r\nthe general rule is that a child is &#8220;truant&#8221; if he or she fails to attend\r\nschool for ten or more days or\r\nparts of days in a six-month period or\r\nfor three or more days or parts\r\nof days in a four-week period.&#160; There are two types of truancy charges.&#160; The first is a &#8220;Parent Contributing to Nonattendance.&#8221;&#160; This is a Class C misdemeanor filed against a\r\nparent for failing to require the child to attend school.&#160; This charge is usually most appropriate when\r\nthe excessively absent student is young and unable to be responsible for and\r\narrange for his or her own attendance at school.&#160; The proper procedure for pursuing this charge\r\nis to have the school&#8217;s attendance officer file a complaint against the parent\r\nin a constitutional county court if the county has a population of 1.75 million\r\nor more, a justice court, or a municipal court where the parent resides or the\r\nschool is located.&#160; </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 6pt;"><b>&#8220;Failure to\r\nAttend School&#8221;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">The second type\r\nof truancy charge, a &#8220;Failure to Attend School&#8221; charge, is a Class C\r\nmisdemeanor filed against a student who is 12 years or older and younger than\r\n18 years.&#160; Generally,\r\njuvenile courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction over these types of\r\ntruancy cases.&#160; Therefore, the proper\r\nprocedure is usually to file a referral to juvenile court. &#160;However, many counties do not have juvenile\r\ncourts.&#160; In those counties, or if a\r\njuvenile court waives its jurisdiction, a &#8220;Failure to Attend School&#8221; charge can\r\nbe prosecuted by filing a complaint in the constitutional county, justice, or\r\nmunicipal court in the same manner as &#8220;Parent Contributing to Nonattendance&#8221;\r\ncases. &#160;In fact, when the truancy charge\r\ninvolves an older student and there is a discrepancy over who the responsible\r\nparty is for the student&#8217;s failure to attend school as required, it is not\r\nuncommon for a school attendance officer to file a &#8220;Parent Contributing to Nonattendance&#8221;\r\ncharge against a parent as well as a &#8220;Failure to Attend School&#8221; charge against\r\nthe student.&#160; </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">During the 2013\r\nLegislative Session, the Texas Legislature added Subchapter E-1 to the Texas\r\nEducation Code, which provides new procedures that schools should follow to\r\nprosecute and sanction students for &#8220;school offenses.&#8221;&#160; An example of one new amendment is &#167;\r\n37.143(a), under which a peace officer now may not issue a citation to a child\r\nwho is &#8220;alleged to have committed a school offense.&#8221; &#160;In the context of truancy, it is important to\r\nmake the distinction as to whether a &#8220;Failure to Attend School&#8221; charge is\r\nconsidered a &#8220;school offense&#8221; and thus falls under the requirements set forth\r\nin these amendments.&#160; &#167; 37.141(2) defines\r\na &#8220;school offense&#8221; as &#8220;an offense committed by a child enrolled in a public\r\nschool that is a Class C misdemeanor other than a traffic offense and that is\r\ncommitted on property under the control and jurisdiction of a school district.&#8221;&#160; Based on this definition of &#8220;school offense,&#8221;\r\nit seems that these amended provisions are not overly relevant in the context\r\nof a &#8220;Failure to Attend School&#8221; charge since although it is a Class C\r\nmisdemeanor, it is seldom committed on school property (in fact, the offense is\r\na result of the student not being at school when required).&#160; However, it is prudent to be aware of these\r\nnew &#8220;school offense&#8221; amendments, as they apply to all Class C misdemeanors,\r\nother than traffic offenses, that occur on school property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify;"><b>Let&#8217;s Bring the Student Back to School</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">The goal of\r\ntruancy standards is not to punish the excessively absent student, but to\r\nreturn him or her to the classroom.&#160; In\r\nthis Legislative Session, the Legislature re-emphasized our state&#8217;s preference to\r\nremedy the underlying issues that are making a student miss school, rather than\r\nimposing consequences for absences after the fact.&#160; As such, beginning September 1, 2013, under\r\nthe newly enacted Texas Education Code &#167; 25.0915(c), if a school district files\r\na truancy complaint without including a statement that complies with Subsection\r\n(b), namely stating that the school applied truancy prevention measures to the\r\nstudent, that the truancy measures failed to meaningfully address the student&#8217;s\r\nattendance, and whether the student is eligible to receive or receives special\r\neducation services, then the court must dismiss the truancy complaint.&#160; In effect, the Legislature is now requiring\r\nthe school to provide evidence of its attempts to address the student&#8217;s truancy\r\nwithout the need for court intervention before the school can pursue truancy charges.\r\nPresumably, this is an attempt by the Legislature to not only assist courts in\r\nmanaging their caseloads, but also to ensure that truancy statutes are carried\r\nout for their intended purpose &#8211; to bolster school attendance, not criminalize\r\nstudents and their parents. &#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">The Legislature has also\r\nincreased judges&#8217; discretion in how a student may discharge fines that may be assessed\r\nagainst him or her in the court&#8217;s judgment on a &#8220;Failure to Attend School&#8221;\r\ncharge.&#160; Now, under the newly added Articles\r\n42.15(d)(1) and 45.041(b-3)(1) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure,\r\njuvenile court judges and justice and municipal court judges may allow a\r\nstudent to perform community service or receive tutoring as a way for the\r\nstudent to &#8220;work off&#8221; the fines.&#160; This\r\nappears to be another attempt of the Legislature to &#8220;rehabilitate&#8221; the student,\r\nrather than punish him or her financially.&#160;&#160;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">&#160;</p>\r\n\r\nApparently,\r\nthe legislative intent behind these new amendments is not to punish students,\r\nbut merely to encourage them to attend school consistently.&#160; Certainly, it is counterintuitive to have a\r\nstudent miss instructional time to attend judicial proceedings on truancy\r\ncharges, and it is definitely not the desire of schools to sully a student&#8217;s\r\nrecord with criminal charges or to make him or her suffer the financial burden\r\nof fines.&#160; Although time will tell if\r\nthese amendments will actually achieve more consistent student attendance, they\r\nappear, at least in theory, to be consistent with school districts&#8217; objectives.&#160;'

aS'<p class=" " /><p class=" ">Distracted driving is an umbrella term&#160;which defines the use of an electronic devise of any kind while driving, including but not limited to hand-held and hands-free cell phone use. In 2009, Webster&#8217;s New World Dictionary proclaimed it &#8220;the word of the year.&#8221; The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that at any moment in time the prevalence of drivers talking on their cellphones is 11%. According to The <a href="http://www.nsc.org/safety&#95;road/Distracted&#95;Driving/Documents/Dstrct&#95;Drvng&#95;White&#95;Paper&#95;Fnl(5-25-10).pdf">National Safety Council</a>&#160;(NSC), approximately 25% of all auto and trucking accidents in 2008 involved a driver talking on the cell phone. </p><p class=" ">It would seem that innovative technologies designed to make our lives easier have instead stepped-up the pressure to increase productivity, making it tempting to use our cell phones while driving from place to place. We call this multi-tasking. But in fact, science shows that the brain is not wired to process more than one task at a time. Instead, thought activities are handled in sequence or succession. Incoming information to the brain is filtered for action and encoding; too much information, i.e. more than can be processed, is filtered out. Since we cannot consciously choose which information is encoded and which is filtered out, this becomes of greatest concern when &#8220;multi-tasking&#8221; behind the wheel of a car or a commercial truck in motion. In other words, a natural lapse in critical data may be the impetus for a tragic accident or fatality. According to the National Safety Council, estimates indicate drivers using cell phones look, but fail to see, up to 50% of the information in their driving environment. Have you ever had a conversation while driving and after arriving at your destination, you don&#8217;t remember the drive at all?</p>\r\n<p class=" ">The official U.S. Government <a href="http://www.distraction.gov/">website</a> for distracted driving states:&#160; &#8220;In 2009 alone, nearly 5,500 people were killed and 450,000 more were injured in distracted driving crashes.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p class=" ">Many states have enacted laws against texting behind the wheel. Effective July 1<sup>st</sup>, 2011, Indiana passed legislation <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title9/ar21/ch8.html">(IC 9-21-8-59)</a> making it illegal to text, receive a text or read a text while driving a motorized vehicle unless the device is equipped with voice-operated technology; an emergency call to 911 being the exception. However, a sub-section of the same legislation forbids officers to confiscate the texting device to determine compliance or as evidence to be used against the driver in Court; the latter&#160;section making it difficult, if not impossible, to enforce the ban on texting.</p>\r\n<p class=" ">Under the commerce clause of the Constitution, legislators recently passed federal laws banning commercial truck and bus drivers from using hand-held devices while driving. It is likely that in the future commercial carriers will be equipped with devices that can read incoming texts aloud and send out voice-activated texts.</p>\r\n<p class=" ">The National Safety Council sees the ban on hand-held devices as only a partial cure to the existing problem since hand&#8217;s free devices do not remove the issue of cognitive distraction. How does phone conversation differ from conversation with a passenger? NSC believes that a passenger shares the driving experience and can suppress conversation under challenging conditions whereas the suppression of conversation on a cell phone may be considered rude. In an AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety survey, 83 percent of respondents said drivers using cell phones are a &#8220;serious&#8221; or &#8220;extremely serious&#8221; problem, yet\r\nmore than half of the respondents stated they had engaged in this behavior in the last 30 days. Participants to the survey saw the problem of cell phone use as only slightly less of an issue than driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>\r\n<p class=" ">At this time, the NSC seeks to inform and change behavior voluntarily through education and self-discipline. But in the future I would anticipate that as support grows for legislation banning the use of hands-free devices, states will begin to fall in line on this issue.</p>\r\n<p class=" ">Accidents involving commercial trucks or semi tractor-trailers require an extensive knowledge of commercial codes, federal legislation&#160;and state laws.

See <i>Bruner v. Office of Personnel Management</i>, 996 F.2d 290, 294 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <i>Marczewski v. Office of Personnel Management</i>, 80 M.S.P.R. 343 (1998). </p><p>Further, in more recent cases, the Merit Systems Protection Board has held that the Bruner Presumption also applies where &#8220;removal for extended absences is equivalent to removal for physical inability to perform where it is accompanied by specifications indicating that the decision to remove was based on medical documentation suggesting that the appellant was disabled and unable to perform her duties.&#8221; <u>McCurdy</u> v. <u>OPM</u>, DA-844E-03-0088-I-1 (April 30, 2004), citing as authority <u>Ayers-Kavtaradze </u>v. <u>Office of Personnel Management</u>, 91 M.S.P.R. 397 (2002). </p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If a Federal or Postal employee is about to be removed, a &quot;preemptive action&quot; of attempting to negotiate with the Agency is often a good idea -- to let the agency know that, if the removal action is properly characterized, then the employee will forego his/her appeal rights.&#160; The benefit to the agency is:&#160; they get the vacant position to fill, and no litigation headaches before the Merit Systems Protection Board.&#160; The benefit to the employee:&#160; Application of the Bruner Presumption, and an enhanced chance that his/her disability retirement application will be approved at the First Stage.</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On the flip-side, if the termination has already occurred, but it is not characterized as a termination based upon a &quot;medical inability to perform one's job&quot;, then it is often a good idea to file an appeal with the MSPB and attempt to negotiate a change in the substantive basis for the termination.&#160; All of this, of course, presumes that the employee does in fact suffer from a medical condition which impacts his or her ability to perform the essential elements of the job.</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Sincerely, Robert R.

aS'Personal injury covers any wrong or damage done to another in his person, property, rights, or reputation. Injuries can happen at work, in a traffic accident, because of a faulty product or a faulty repair, because of a mistake during medical treatment, or because you slipped and fell on pavement or on a wet floor. The injury can be physical or psychological, but, to have a case, it must occur due to the negligence or unreasonably unsafe actions of your employer, a manufacturer, your doctor, your landlord, or some other person or organization who owes you a duty of ordinary care.'

Then obtain advice and representation from an experienced personal injury attorney.</p><p><strong>The complexity of identifying liability</strong></p><p>A driver who rear-ends a stopped vehicle might appear to be the obviously liable party in the accident. But even this simple example might have complexities, such as the following:</p><ul><li>The driver of the front vehicle might have suddenly cut off the other driver and then stopped.</li><li>The driver of the rear vehicle may have appropriately applied the brakes, only to discover that recent brake repairs failed.</li><li>After stopping behind the front vehicle, a third vehicle may have rear-ended the driver of the rear vehicle, pushing it into the front vehicle.</li></ul><p>These examples illustrate the importance of talking to attorneys who have experience with these matters.

But a key point in determining negligence involves Missouri comparative negligence law.</p><p>The law addresses the fact that more than one individual may share liability for a given accident&#8212;including an injured victim. Under Missouri law, even a victim whose negligence contributed to the accident can still pursue compensation from others, but the law reduces their damages based on their degree of negligence. Theoretically, an injured individual with 99 percent of liability for an accident can still pursue one percent of damages from others who shared liability.</p><p>Looking at a different aspect of the law, Missouri follows joint and several liability rules that determine liability when more than one party has responsibility for your damages. When one party has 51 percent or more of the fault, the victim can pursue full compensation from that liable party, leaving him or her to settle any differences with other at-fault individuals. On the other hand, if no single party has the majority of fault, the victim must pursue compensation from each liable party based on degree of responsibility.</p><p><strong>Contact an experienced St. Louis personal injury attorney for a free consultation</strong></p><p>If you incur injuries from any type of <a href="http://www.gatewayinjurylaw.com/aop/St-Louis-automobile-accidents/">accident</a> in Missouri caused by negligent or willful acts of other parties, you need to learn your legal options before taking action to pursue compensation.

aS'Being arrested for a DWI in New Jersey carries lengthy license suspensions and serious monetary fines. Taking a breathalyzer exam is required by law if an officer stops you for a DWI, according to New Jersey&#8217;s implied consent law. The officer must have probable cause for the motor vehicle stop as well as the request for a breath test that will be used to determine your blood alcohol content (BAC).   While the officer cannot force you to take the test, refusing to submit to a breath test is a separate charge that carries similar harsh penalties.\r\n\r\nThe officer cannot force you take a breath test after your arrest, but refusing will result in a license suspension for seven months and a fine of $300 to $500. A second refusal increases the penalties to a two-year license suspension and a fine of $500 to $1,000. If this is your third time refusing a breathalyzer test, you will face a suspension that lasts ten years and a $1,000 fine. If the arrest for a DWI takes place on school grounds or within 1,000 feet of a school, the punishments are doubled.\r\n\r\nDWI Conviction Still Possible Without Breathalyzer\r\n\r\nYour refusal to take the test can come in the form of a &#8220;no&#8221;, silence, a conditional response, or an unclear response.  However, conviction for a DWI is still possible even without the breath test that determines if your BAC is over the legal limit of .08. The prosecution can use your refusal to submit to a breath test as evidence in your drunk driving case. Field sobriety tests and other &#8220;probable cause&#8221; signs can also be used as evidence. For these reasons, there is usually no benefit in refusing to take a blood, breath, or urine test when arrested for a DWI.

aS'<br /><br />A revolutionary new technology would use a series of tiny electrical impulses from implanted devices to allow a paralyzed person with a spinal cord injury to move his limbs. Preliminary tests have revealed almost miraculous results. In one case, a person who had suffered a stroke and had been left paralyzed in one arm was able to begin playing golf. In another case, a person paralyzed from the chest down was soon able enough to do deep knee bends. Both are cases where the patients were looking at years of severely restricted movement.<br /><br />The technology works through implanted microstimulators that deliver a series of automated impulses. These impulses can lead to muscle contractions that help the person to imitate the natural movements of his limbs. All the technology requires to benefit more spinal injury patients is the right bandwidth or electronic spectrum. The nonprofit Alfred Mann Foundation has appealed to the government for the use of four bands of electromagnetic spectrum. That would not have been a problem, except that these four bands are already being used by other major entities. <br /><br />The Foundation wants to use 413 to 419 MHz, which is currently being used by emergency land mobile radio. 426 to 432 MHz and 438 to 444 MHz are being used by the military for radar, and 451 to 457 MHz is being used by commercial television stations for breaking news or traffic reports. Portions of the spectrum are currently being used by private users under part 15 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations. These devices are typically used in low power transmitters, for example, in baby monitors. It is this part 15 that the Alfred Mann Foundation is looking at in order to operate this revolutionary technology. <br /><br />However, the current users of the bandwidth spectrum are not too keen on sharing their bandwidth for the operation of a medical device. They have their concerns. Say for instance, there is a television crew breaking news at a site using the spectrum. If there is a patient nearby with the implanted device, the high-power transmission could seriously impact the functioning of the device, threatening the safety of the patient.<br /><br />The Alfred Mann Foundation says these concerns are not valid, because the device is engineered to resist harmful interference. Further, according to the Alfred Mann Foundation, there is no question of choosing another section of the bandwidth. This is the only section that allows the technology to work the way it is meant to. <br /><br />Obviously, this is a difficult situation. The kind of results the technology has shown so far are bound to excite <a title="Spine Injury Attorneys Los Angeles" href="http://www.brain-spineinjury.com/">California spine injury lawyers</a>. Hopefully, there can be some sort of compromise which will allow the technology to be used safely to benefit patients, without harmful interference.<br /><!--more-->A revolutionary new technology would use a series of tiny electrical impulses from implanted devices to allow a paralyzed person with a spinal cord injury to move his limbs.

Using these possibilities as a back drop in workout negotiations can improve the outcome for the borrower. </p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt">Borrowers try to avoid liquidation because they lose their assets.&#160; In Ch. 7, lenders often receive less than they might otherwise.&#160; In contrast, the successful Ch. 11 requires that the creditors receive at least as much as they would in Ch. 7.&#160; Consequently, creditors usually view their situation with liquidation in mind, even though the Debtor will not undergo liquidation.</p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt">With a bankruptcy filing&#160; as an unwanted but real option, borrowers are using the potential outcome of that process as leverage to persuade lenders to workout defaulted loans without the borrower having to actually file a Chapter 11 proceeding. &#160;&#160;By using the bankruptcy process as a framework for settlement negotiations, borrowers can alter a bank&#8217;s perception of its potential outcome in a Ch. 11 proceeding,&#160; thereby enhancing the borrower&#8217;s negotiating position.&#160; </p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt">In Ch. 11, secured debt that exceeds the value of the secured asset will be treated as unsecured debt.&#160; So long as unsecured lenders receive more in the Ch. 11 reorganization plan (&#8220;Plan&#8221;) than they would in a liquidation (&#8220;Ch. 7&#8221;), the Court will often approve the Plan with payments over as long as five years, often at a small percentage of the underlying obligation.&#160; After the Plan is approved, the secured debt moving forward will be the fair market value of the property, not the face value of the Note.&#160; The Plan can also readjust interest rates, payment amount and even extend loans that are close to maturity sometimes without the lender&#8217;s approval.</p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt">Presenting the potential Ch. 11 outcome in a pre-bankruptcy workout setting can be very useful in successfully negotiating a workout with your lender.&#160; Even if unsuccessful, the strategic work necessary to formulate and present a proposal to the lender can be used in documenting the Plan in a Ch. 11 proceeding, thus decreasing the cost of preparing a Plan.&#160; These negotiations and processes are complex but can be very effective.&#160; The foregoing is intended to alert the reader to the opportunities,&#160; but in no way a comprehensive discussion.&#160;&#160; The main point to remember is that positive outcomes can be realized. </p><p MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><i>Miller Law Group, P.C. is a full-service <a href="http://millerlg.com/practice-areas/hospitality/">hospitality law</a> firm representing hotel owners and management companies.&#160; For more information about the firm, visit www.millerlg.com or contact us at 650-566-2290.</i></p><!--more-->Miller Law Group, P.C. is a full-service hospitality law firm representing hotel owners and management companies.&#160; For more information about the firm, visit www.millerlg.com or contact us at 650-566-2290.'

aS'The Bay Area has always been a region known for its emphasis on public mass transit.&#160; As such, there are large numbers of buses, trains, and subways that operate every day in cities like San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose.&#160; Due to the volume of buses, however, and the hectic pace of urban living, collisions and accidents are unfortunate and tragic occurrences that happen all too often.&#160; In an effort to curb these potential disasters from happening the MUNI system in San Francisco is trying a different way of monitoring operator safety by monitoring their drivers with cameras to ensure that they are not paying more attention to their phones than the road. &#160;<br /><br />In the past few years a real problem that has been encountered with drivers is the problem of cellular phones, and more specifically, with texting.&#160; Operators both in MUNI as well as other transit agencies in California have found that their drivers are texting on the job, even while driving.&#160; One such case resulted in a massive tragedy in the Los Angeles area in 2008, when a train conductor, who was believed to be paying more attention to the texts he was receiving than the rail, crashed a train, killing 25 people.&#160; More locally, a MUNI subway operator crashed as a result of him paying more attention to texts than to the road.&#160; His train slammed into another rail vehicle, hurting 12 people, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. &#160;<br /><br /><br />According to the Chronicle MUNI is going to start implementing cameras located in the operator&#8217;s cab in all light rail vehicles in the system.&#160; The cameras will record the drivers as they work, ensuring that they do not engage in texting or use their mobile phones to talk.&#160; If they are caught in either activity, they will find that they will not be working for MUNI any longer, according to Commissioner Mike Florio.&#160; Hopefully this plan will succeed.&#160; Though MUNI has been experiencing a general drop in accidents, and especially grievous ones, the addition of cameras ensuring that MUNI drivers are engaging their jobs and not their friends is a comforting one for all pedestrians and motorists in San Francisco.<br /><br />If you&#8217;ve been hurt in a bus accident, or any accident involving a motor vehicle, please do not hesitate to contact Allegiance Law.&#160; We are an aggressive, experienced law firm that is committed to helping out anyone who has been wronged on the road, especially if they&#8217;ve been struck and hurt by a bus or subway.&#160; If you feel like you have a case, please give us a call.&#160; Your &#8220;small&#8221; claim may be much larger than you think.&#160; You can contact us at (415) 404-6395.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.allegiancelaw.com/">Allegiance Law</a>: <a href="http://www.allegiancelaw.com/personal&#95;injury">The San Francisco Personal Injury Attorneys</a>&#160; &#160;<br /><br />'

Kirkham, Chaon &amp; Kirkham</em> (1971) 18 Cal. App.3d 54. The plaintiff in <em>Consolidated Electrical </em>was a materials supplier that<em> </em>furnished\r\n fixtures to an electrical subcontractor for use in the construction of \r\nan elementary school. After the electrical contractor filed for \r\nbankruptcy, the supplier filed suit seeking payment pursuant to a stop \r\nnotice and a labor and material bond.</p>\r\n<p class="FlushLeft">At trial, in support of its claim, the supplier \r\nrelied on the electrical contractor&#8217;s purchase orders, invoices showing \r\nshipment of the materials to the jobsite and a certified copy of the \r\nblueprints from the job. &#160;Additionally,\r\n the supplier&#8217;s office manager testified that he had reviewed the \r\nschool&#8217;s blueprints, including the &#8220;electrical-site plan &amp; \r\nschedules&#8221; and &#8220;fixture schedule&#8221; in detail, and prior to its \r\ncompletion, he had made two visits to the school and observed the \r\nsubcontractor incorporating the materials into the school building. &#160;In\r\n essence, he testified that the types of fixtures provided for in the \r\nblueprints were in the finished school and corresponded to the types and\r\n amount of fixtures which had been ordered by the subcontractor from \r\nplaintiff. &#160;The manager, \r\nhowever, did not physically inspect every room in the school, but \r\ntestified that according to the blue prints, the materials used in every\r\n room in the school were the same.&#160; </p>\r\n<p class="FlushLeft">The court held that the manager&#8217;s testimony was \r\nsufficient to sustain the supplier&#8217;s burden of proving the incorporation\r\n of the materials into the project. In doing so, the court stated that \r\n&#8220;actual use&#8221; of the material could be inferred from the testimony of the\r\n manager that the plans called for the use of identical materials \r\nthroughout the project. &#160;Thus, in accordance with the <em>Consolidated Electrical </em>case,<em> </em>a material supplier must show more than delivery of the materials to a site to enforce a stop notice or to foreclose on a mechanic&#8217;s lien.&#160; Indeed,\r\n once a purchaser&#8217;s account becomes overdue, a prudent material supplier\r\n should begin gathering evidence which shows its materials were actually\r\n used in the subject project.&#160; Moreover,\r\n where plans call for the repetitive use of materials on identical \r\nstructures or rooms, &#8220;actual use&#8221; of the materials throughout the entire\r\n project may be shown by extrapolation evidence (i.e. an inference that \r\nthe same materials were used throughout the project based on the \r\nidentical nature of the rooms and physical examination of the materials \r\nused in a some of the rooms.)</p>'

aS'<p /><p>I have blogged about defendants in <a title="Boston Automobile Accident" href="http://www.feinbergalban.com/practice-areas/auto-accidents/">automobile accident</a> cases who will attribute a collision to weather conditions that they claim made the accident unavoidable. Of course, my rejoinder is that a driver acting reasonably must take into account the prevailing weather or road conditions. Inclement weather is one such defense that comes up. Seriously, though, doesn&#8217;t reasonable conduct require a driver to proceed slowly and not to be able to say I couldn&#8217;t do anything about it. (There are some instances, of course, where this defense may be valid but often it is not, as the driver was going too fast under the circumstances.) Sun glare is an interesting defense which I have seen attempted on more than a couple of occasions. There are not many cases from Massachusetts concerning sun glare. However a 1995 appeal from a motor vehicle surcharge speaks impliedly to this issue. In a Superior Court decision on the driver&#8217;s appeal from a finding of fault, the judge noted that the other vehicles were able to stop safely under the same circumstances and thus gave no credit to a state police report which determined that sun glare caused the accident. <u>Dumont v.

As soon as the decision of withdrawal will become permanent, the CSSF will request from the Luxembourg court (tribunal d\'arrondissement) the judicial liquidation of HERALD (LUX). In case of a liquidation decided upon by the court, the court will appoint a liquidator to realize the assets of the SICAV.</p><p>Should you have any questions, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:oliviersciales@cs-avocats.lu">oliviersciales@cs-avocats.lu</a>.</p>'

aS'<p />\r\n<p />\r\n<p>One frequent statement after a motorcycle crash is &#8220;I didn\'t see him&#8221;. This statement represents the problem that many motorcycle riders face&#8211;they are not very visible.</p>\r\n<p />\r\n<p>This dilemma known as motorcycle conspicuity is simply &#160;that motorcycles are harder to see than cars and trucks. Some avid motorcycle riders have taken it upon themselves to add lighting to their motorcycle to help make it more visible.</p>\r\n<p />\r\n<p>You may even recall, watching a young person riding a bicycle with an antenna attached to a flag. This was a knowing parent\'s attempt to make their child more visible to motorists and keep them safe. A motorcycle rider is well served to follow that example and make themselves more visable to other motorists.&#160;</p>\r\n<p />\r\n<p>Another way that a motorcycle rider can help make himself more visible is to wear brightly colored clothing or reflective material. Unfortunately, that is not much in keeping with the motorcycle rider image many strive to maintain. Additionally, motorcycle riders are well advised to keep headlights on even in the daytime. Studies have shown that this increases their visibility and thus decreases susceptibility to a motorcycle accident.</p>\r\n<p />\r\n<p>Common sense dictates that a prudent motorcycle rider may try to avoid the busy highways in large cities like Houston during rush-hour traffic. Sometimes in rush-hour traffic, it is difficult to see even large cars and trucks due to the limited space and congestion. In those conditions motorcycle riders are much more likely to be involved in an accident.</p><p /><p>Greg Baumgartner is&#160;the founder of the Baumgartner law firm, which is dedicated to helping personal injury victims seek civil justice.

aS'Costa Mesa is a region adjacent to the beach of Orange County, California.\r\nTo be more precise, it can be said that Costa Mesa is located in the\r\nsurrounding area of the Huntington and Newport Beach of California. Every day,\r\nmany young fellows come here to party, surf and ride motorcycles. Motorcycle\r\naccidents are quite frequent here. What are the most common factors leading to\r\nmotorcycle accidents in Costa Mesa? &#160;Costa\r\nMesa motorcycle accidents occur mainly due to irresponsible and careless\r\ndriving by the motorist operating the other vehicle involved in the accident\r\nand also due to the dire roads. \r\n\r\n<p>There is hardly any place that is free from accidents. It can be a simple\r\nincident involving a person riding down the road and skidding while passing\r\nthrough a wet or slippery spot; or it may be a serious accident where the\r\nindividuals and vehicles involved in it get more critically harmed. The city of\r\nCosta Mesa is not devoid of these mishaps. Riding a motorcycle offers a lot of\r\nfun; however, it also invites several hazards. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The severity of the consequences of the motorcycle accidents in Costa Mesa\r\nvaries. Sometimes people meeting accidents get minor cuts and bruises; the more\r\ngrave effects include internal hemorrhage, breaking of bones, brain injury and\r\nat times death. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some reports from the city&#8217;s motorcycle accident attorneys suggest that they\r\nhave clients suffering from medical conditions like herniated disks and\r\nparaplegia. There are also cases where the individuals involved in the accident\r\nhave suffered from concussion of the head. People may wear helmets, but that is\r\nnot enough for avoiding impact to one&#8217;s brain. Emotional trauma is one of the\r\nmost common consequences of any accident; it often causes psychological disorders.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common factors leading to these accidents include bad road\r\nconditions, rash driving, distracted and drunk drivers. If you have been\r\ninvolved in any such accident, visit an experienced Costa Mesa motorcycle\r\naccident attorney. He will guide you about the damages for which you can take\r\nlegal actions.

No one\r\nknows when a bus or other vehicle the district purchases may turn out to be a\r\nlemon. Though such an occurrence is unlikely, it is also unpredictable.&#160; It is always better to be prepared for that\r\nevent rather than lamenting that you wish you had the necessary documentation\r\nto prove your vehicle is a lemon and possibly qualify to have the manufacturer\r\nbuy back or replace the vehicle.</p><p>\r\n\r\nA\r\nproblem vehicle has three ways to be declared a &#8220;lemon&#8221;:&#160; </p><p>\r\n\r\n1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\r\nThe\r\nvehicle was in the shop for the same problem or defect twice within the first\r\n12 months or 12,000 miles (whichever comes first) AND twice more during the 12\r\nmonths or 12,000 miles following the first repair AND the problem is still not\r\nrepaired; OR</p><p>\r\n\r\n2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\r\nThe\r\nvehicle was taken for repair of a serious safety hazard once during the first\r\n12 months or 12,000 miles (whichever comes first) AND once more during the 12\r\nmonths of 12,000 miles following the first repair AND the problem is still not\r\nrepaired; OR</p><p>\r\n\r\n3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\r\nThe\r\nvehicle was out of service for warranty repair for a total of 30+ days (not\r\nnecessarily consecutive days) during the first 24 months or 24,000 miles, AND\r\nthere were two repair attempts during the first 12 months or 12,000 miles after\r\ndelivery, AND a substantial problem still exists. Days for which you had a\r\nloaner vehicle do not count toward the 30 days out of service.&#160; Tex. Occ. Code Ann. &#167; 2301.605 (West 2012).</p><p>\r\n\r\nA\r\n&#8220;serious safety hazard&#8221; is a life-threatening malfunction that substantially\r\nimpedes a person&#8217;s ability to control or operate a vehicle for ordinary use or\r\nintended purposes, or creates a substantial risk of fire or explosion.&#160; Tex. Occ. Code Ann. &#167; 2301.601(4) (West\r\n2012).</p><p>\r\n\r\nWhile\r\nthere are state laws that protect consumers (including school districts) from\r\nlemon vehicles, there are certain documents that are required to make a Lemon\r\nLaw claim.&#160; Because the timeline to file\r\na Lemon Law claim is tight, it is essential that districts always maintain\r\nthese records on vehicles, especially buses, so when problems start to pile up,\r\nthe documents are ready and available.</p><p>\r\n\r\n<b>The Invoice</b></p><p>\r\n\r\nThe\r\nfirst document you will need to produce to make a Lemon Law claim is the\r\npurchase invoice.&#160; The invoice should\r\nshow the date the vehicle was delivered, the company selling the vehicle, and\r\nthe mileage on the vehicle when it was delivered.&#160; Many school districts purchase their vehicles\r\nthrough the TASB &#8220;Buy Board&#8221;, but the vehicle is actually invoiced from a\r\nvehicle dealer.&#160; It is the dealer&#8217;s\r\ninvoice that you need to retain. &#160;The\r\ndealer must also provide you a Manufacturer&#8217;s Certificate of Origin, which will\r\nshow the mileage on the vehicle at the time of delivery. Keep this document, as\r\nwell. Also keep the card of any sales representative that you deal with during\r\nthe transaction.</p><p>\r\n\r\n<b>The Warranty</b></p><p>\r\n\r\nVirtually\r\nevery new vehicle comes with some sort of manufacturer&#8217;s warranty.&#160; By state law, every school bus must have a\r\nbumper-to-bumper warranty for the first two years of ownership, with unlimited\r\nmileage. 37 Tex. Admin. Code &#167; 14.52(a).&#160;\r\nThis is known as the Texas Minimum Warranty. The dealer must provide the\r\nManufacturer&#8217;s New Vehicle Warranty, plus a warranty of every major component\r\npart. These will be the warranties for the tires, battery, engine and possibly\r\nthe chassis. ALL these warranties are essential documents when making a Lemon\r\nLaw claim, so they should not be discarded or left in the glove box of the vehicle.\r\nIn addition, a bus warranty start date can be reset from the actual delivery\r\ndate to the date the bus actually begins service in your district if you notify\r\nthe delivering dealer of the date on which you place the bus in service. To\r\nreset the date, you must give notification of the in-service date to the\r\ndelivering dealer within 90 days of the original delivery date.&#160; This conserves the district&#8217;s warranty if,\r\nfor example, you receive a bus in early June but do not put the bus into\r\nservice until the beginning of the following school year.</p><p>\r\n\r\n<b>The Pre-Service Checklist\r\n(buses only)</b></p><p>\r\n\r\nThe\r\nTexas School Bus Specifications require that a school bus purchaser complete a\r\npre-service checklist and keep the completed form with the bus title.&#160; An example is found in the Texas School Bus\r\nSpecifications brochure that is available through the Texas Administrative Code\r\nwebsite as the attached graphic in 37 Tex. Admin. Code &#167; 14.52(a).</p><p>\r\n\r\n<b>The Repair Invoices</b></p><p>\r\n\r\nBecause\r\nan initial repair within the first 12 months or 12,000 miles triggers the\r\nremedies of the Lemon Law, it is essential to demand an invoice for any\r\nwarranty service.&#160; Dealers are sometimes\r\nreluctant to provide such invoices, especially since they do not charge the\r\ndistrict for warranty service.&#160; However,\r\nif the same issue recurs to the point that you may have a Lemon Law claim, you\r\nwill need to produce evidence that you have had the vehicle in for repairs for\r\nthat defect, and the mileage on the vehicle at the time of each repair. That\r\ninformation is typically found on the repair invoice.&#160; The repair shop will probably not mail you a\r\ncopy of the invoice later.&#160; Ask for the\r\ninvoice at the time you pick up the vehicle, and wait for it to be printed, if\r\nnecessary.&#160; If a vehicle is inoperable\r\nand you are unable to reach the delivering dealer to have the vehicle towed,\r\nhave the vehicle towed yourself but get an invoice for the tow. A bus that\r\ncannot be operated at all is a &#8220;serious safety hazard.&#8221;</p><p>\r\n\r\n<b>The Maintenance Records</b></p><p>\r\n\r\nIn\r\ndefending a Lemon Law claim, manufacturers will want to see your maintenance\r\nrecords for the vehicle. Make sure you have some documentation of every oil\r\nchange, every tire rotation, every coolant change per the manufacturer&#8217;s\r\nspecifications.&#160; While commercial records\r\nare just fine and typically identify the mileage on the vehicle at the time of\r\nthe service, locally kept records for in-house service are acceptable, as well,\r\nbut make them consistent.&#160; The more\r\ninformation on the date, mileage and service performed (including grade of oil,\r\ntype of filter, etc.) the better.</p><p>\r\n\r\nBefore\r\nyou file your Lemon Law claim you will want to consult with your district&#8217;s\r\nattorney about additional steps to take. The attorney will want to see the\r\nabove documentation to verify the claim. The manufacturer will get one more\r\nchance to repair the problem, and will probably bring a consulting engineer to\r\ntry to intimidate your personnel. You must make sure that your transportation\r\nfolks are on the same page regarding the condition of the bus and are prepared\r\nto verify that the problem still exists. Good documentation can be the key to a\r\nreplacement vehicle.</p><p>\r\n\r\n</p>'

Personal bankruptcy filings nationwide hit nearly 1.3 million between January and November, up 32 percent over last year. </p><p>High unemployment, the decimated real estate market and a slate of creditor-friendly laws fueled the bankruptcy numbers in Georgia, experts said. </p><p>Georgia&#8217;s numbers are up, but its position near the top of the bankruptcy charts is nothing new. The state has had one of the highest bankruptcy rates in the nation for years. </p><p>What&#8217;s changed for 2009 are the profiles of those filing, with the ranks these days including plenty of people for whom financial instability is a new experience. </p><p>Richard Thomson, a partner at Clark &amp; Washington, a high-volume Atlanta bankruptcy law firm, said early in the economic downturn his firm took on lots of realtors and contractors as clients. </p><p>&#8220;Now other professionals, we&#8217;re seeing them come in more and more,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are higher income and have a lot more assets, a lot more items like boats and motorcycles and four-wheelers.&#8221; </p><p>They simply can&#8217;t pay for what they have, Thomson said. &#8220;They&#8217;re just saying &#8216;Take it. It&#8217;s not worth the effort anymore. I can&#8217;t keep up with it.&#8217;&#160;&#8221; </p><p>Consumers in financial trouble don&#8217;t have the opportunities of the past to stay afloat: New jobs or second jobs to help pay down debt are hard to find, and home equity credit lines and credit card limits have been cut. </p><p>Howard Rothbloom, a high-profile bankruptcy attorney, said that, unlike in the past, he&#8217;s regularly seeing clients who owe more on their homes and cars than they are worth as well as clients who can no longer afford second homes and investment properties. </p><p>He said clients have more debt than ever before, including significant student loan debt and credit cards with escalating interest rates. He said he&#8217;s seeing more men than women who have lost jobs and major income reductions for those who remain employed. </p><p>&#8220;All in all, there is just a lot of financial misery in the world today,&#8221; he said. </p><p>The details of last year&#8217;s bankruptcy filings offer a look at the desperate situations of many Georgians. </p><p>More than half of Georgians filing between January and November opted for Chapter 7 filings, according to the National Bankruptcy Research Center. Chapter 7 is liquidation in which most debts are wiped out, but so are assets that aren&#8217;t protected by exemptions. Among the exemptions: $10,000 in home equity and a paid-for vehicle worth $3,500 or less. </p><p>A Chapter 13 filing, chosen by 47 percent, allows consumers to hold on to a house and car but requires that they repay a portion of their debts. </p><p>That split is new in Georgia, which for years has been dominated by Chapter 13 cases rather than Chapter 7 filings. Holding onto a house and accumulated equity was the factor that pushed many debtors into Chapter 13 in the past. These days, many homeowners have little equity or owe more than their houses are worth. </p><p>Bankruptcy helps people restructure loans and usually shed some debts. But it comes with a price: A bankruptcy is reflected on a consumer&#8217;s credit report for seven to 10 years. That can be costly at a time when credit scores are used for purposes beyond lending decisions, including for screening prospective tenants and job applicants, and even for pricing auto and homeowners insurance. </p><p>&#8220;If you can find another alternative and can pay the debt by any other means, your credit will improve more rapidly than if you file for bankruptcy,&#8221; said Michelle Jones, senior vice president for counseling at Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Atlanta. </p><p>Bankruptcy may not carry the stigma it once did, but it&#8217;s still a devastating experience for many people, especially those who never imagined going bust. </p><p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re seeing now is a situation where people who have never failed in their life, not in elementary school or junior high or high school or college, are failing in a fundamental way that affects them emotionally and affects their loved ones emotionally,&#8221; said Jack Williams, a bankruptcy expert and professor at Georgia State University&#8217;s Law School. </p><p>Georgia has such a high rate of filings, experts say, because the state was hit hard by the downturn in real estate and because unemployment exceeds 10 percent. </p><p>Georgia&#8217;s foreclosure laws also play a significant role in driving up the rate. The state&#8217;s foreclosure process occurs without court or government supervision and takes only weeks. No state has a faster foreclosure process. A bankruptcy filing is the only realistic option for most Georgians seeking to delay a public auction of their homes. </p><p>Among consumers receiving recent pre-bankruptcy counseling, one in five said avoiding foreclosure was the primary reason for seeking bankruptcy protection, according to CCCS. The Atlanta-based nonprofit provides court-mandated counseling to consumers across the nation. </p><p>For homeowners who can afford their mortgages, Jones said, bankruptcy is &#8220;a good tool for stopping that [foreclosure] process and allowing you to get caught up on the mortgage.&#8221; </p><p>The average consumer seeking bankruptcy protection last year was a married white homeowner with an annual income of $43,000, according to statistics compiled by CCCS. This typical consumer has an average of $39,000 in unsecured debt, usually credit cards, on top of secured debts &#8212; usually a mortgage and car payment &#8212; that cost more than $1,600 a month. </p><p>And most have run out of options for getting money from anyone but family and friends: the average credit score of those seeking bankruptcy is 529. </p><p>Last year&#8217;s average bankruptcy filer had debts exceeding assets by about $73,000. In 2008, the average filer wasn&#8217;t quite so much in the red, with debts exceeding assets by $57,000. </p><p>Experts do not expect Georgia&#8217;s numbers to improve soon. </p><p>&#8220;Bankruptcy filings are a lagging economic indicator,&#8221; said Williams, the Georgia State law professor. </p><p>The filings increase after initial spikes in unemployment and other negative economic indicators because most consumers can manage for a while on savings or loans from friends or family before throwing in the towel. </p><p>Williams projects that national filings this year will exceed last year&#8217;s level. And Georgia, he said, is unlikely to improve it position on the bankruptcy charts. </p><p>&#8220;I expect Georgia to stay in the top five,&#8221; he said. </p><p /><b>Personal bankruptcy filings </b><p>Georgia ranked third in a comparison of bankruptcy rates for cases filed between January and November of 2009. </p><p /><p><b>State</b> </p><p><b>rate*%</b> </p><p><b>change**</b> </p><p>1.

aS'<p>Most crimes can be broadly categorized as either felonies or misdemeanors. However, what do those terms even mean? Many people will be surprised to discover that, depending on the state, a misdemeanor can actually bring more jail time than a felony. That&#8217;s why, if you are accused of a crime, you need to seek the services of an experienced Scranton criminal defense lawyer who can advise you about your options.</p><em><strong>Pennsylvania law and the felony/misdemeanor distinction</strong></em><p>Felony and misdemeanor are confusing terms - mostly because, while they are used to categorize crimes across the United States, the meaning of the terms differs from state to state. In Pennsylvania, there are three degrees of felony and three of misdemeanor, with each characterized by the penalty associated with it.</p><p>Scranton criminal defense lawyers are knowledgeable about these distinctions as laid out by Pennsylvania law. That law defines a <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~weinberg/grading.htm" target="&#95;blank">first-degree felony</a> as a crime bringing a penalty of more than 10 years in prison. Second-degree felonies are punished with no more than 10 years, and third-degree felonies with no more than seven years. Further complicating this picture are the penalties for misdemeanors, which may overlap with those for felonies. So, a first-degree misdemeanor has a maximum sentence of five years, a second-degree brings no more than two years, and a third-degree misdemeanor has at most a one-year sentence. This differs from the rules in other states where, for example, a felony may be any crime that brings a sentence over five years and a misdemeanor is everything under that sentence. </p><p>A high degree of variation exists in terms of which crimes are classified as felonies and misdemeanors, and the apparent seriousness of the offense alone will not necessarily let you know what to expect. For example, a crime of theft might be a misdemeanor the first time it occurs, but can elevate to a felony after multiple offenses.

aS'<p>Mother Nature has not been kind to the Philadelphia region this winter.  Icy and snowy conditions have often accompanied the arctic temperatures of winter.   These hazardous wintertime conditions pose potential safety risks for many, including the threat of slip and fall accidents and increased risk of auto accidents.</p><b>Slip and Fall Accidents Caused by Ice and Snow</b><p>Wintertime conditions such as freezing rain, sleet, ice, packed snow, and snow covered ice create the perfect setting for a slip and fall accident.  Steps, sidewalks, driveways, and parking lots are some potentially dangerous areas for outdoor slip and fall accidents.  When snow and ice are tracked indoors, the risk of accident increases as puddles form causing slippery conditions indoors.  <b></b></p><p>Generally speaking, homeowners and business owners are responsible to keep their properties safe from potential hazards.  This means removing snow and ice from sidewalks and other public areas and walkways.  A property owner must take this responsibility seriously during the inclement winter weather.  If ice or snow amasses at a business owner&#8217;s property and creates an unsafe condition resulting in a slip and fall accident, the property owner may be held liable for the person&#8217;s injuries.  The laws for snow and ice removal vary from state to state, and even townships and municipalities have their own ordinances regarding snow and ice removal for sidewalks and other public areas. Because this area of law can be complex, the help of a knowledgeable personal injury lawyer is essential if you suffer a fall on another&#8217;s property.<b></b></p><b>Wintertime Auto Accidents</b><p>Driving in the snow and ice can often be frightening for many motorists.  Winter driving conditions can include snow covered roads, freezing rain, black ice and visibility &#8220;whiteouts.&#8221;  The safest way to avoid a car accident in hazardous winter situations is to stay off the road whenever possible.  If you are driving during a snowstorm or other dangerous weather conditions, make sure you prepare your car for winter and know how to properly maneuver your vehicle in poor weather.</p><p>Drive slowly, allow ample distance between your vehicle and other cars, and avoid slamming on the brakes.  Preparing your car for winter and predicting and avoiding dangerous situations will help prevent a car accident.  If you employ some of these safety tips you can reduce the risk of an auto accident from a winter storm and keep yourself, your passengers, and other drivers on the road safe.</p><b>The Philadelphia Personal Injury Lawyers at Galfand Berger Can Answer Your Questions about Accident Liability in Icy &amp; Snowy Conditions</b><p>The <a  rel="nofollow" title="Pennsylvania Personal Injury Lawyers" href="http://www.galfandberger.com/aop/"><b><i>personal injury attorneys</i></b></a> at <a  rel="nofollow" title="Personal Injury Attorneys Helping People" href="http://www.galfandberger.com/"><b><i>Galfand Berger, LLP </i></b></a>represent individuals injured by the negligence of others who fail to take proper care in winter&#8217;s icy and snowy conditions.

The bill passed the House of Representatives earlier in 2012 (House of Representatives Bill 3289), so all that remains now is for the President of the United States to sign it, and the majority of its provisions will take effect 30 days thereafter.</p><p>The bill is called the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012. It amends the existing Federal protections primarilly at&#160;Section&#160;2302, in Title 5 of the United States Code.

The WPA of 2012 clarifies that all disclosures, whether formal or informal, are protected where &quot;the employee or applicant providing the disclosure&#160;reasonably believes that the disclosure evidences any violation of law, rule, or regulation, and occurs during the conscientious carryout out of official duties; or gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.&quot; See&#160;Committee Statement and Views of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform accompanying H.R. 3289, Rept. 112-508 Part 1, 112th Congress 2nd Session.</p><p>Significantly, the act transfers appeal rights from the United States Appeals Court for the Federal&#160;to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia because Congress feels the Federal Circuit Court has misapplied the existing whistleblower provisions in a manner that has lead to discourage potential whistleblowers from coming forward. See Committee Statement and Views of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform accompanying H.R. 3289, Rept. 112-508 Part 1, 112th Congress 2nd Session.

aS'August 16, 2010 (by Ehline Law) Statistics show that civil lawsuits for injuries and <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/pages/3420/expert&#95;losangeleswrongfuldeathattorneys.htm">wrongful death from vehicle accidents</a><p> has fallen approximately 46 percent from 2001-2002 and 2007-2008, which is the latest statistics available. \r\n\r\nIt is not unusual for personal injury lawyers to have television advertisements questioning if there have been injuries due to a vehicle crash and if this has caused undue expenses for medical bills and other responsibilities. \r\n\r\n</p><p>The answer to these questions in California according to the data is that less people are answering yes to those questions. The California Superior Courts total of civil lawsuits has been fixed at approximately 1.5 million. \r\n\r\nPersonal injury claims have dropped to some extent, but not to the degree of vehicle crash lawsuits, with the numbers of California claims in 2001-2002 by drivers, passengers and pedestrians numbered 52,809 for injuries, damage and wrongful death. The data shows the same time period during 2007-2008 there were 28,414 claims filed for the same reasons. \r\n\r\n</p><p>According to Administrative Office spokesman Philip R. Carrizosa, when emailed by California Watch, his answer was one cause of this decrease can be attributed to SB 668, which allows people more time to settle their case without the need to file a lawsuit. This also allowed victims of the September 11th terrorist attack more time to decide if they would take legal action against the airlines. California is now in line with most other states providing a two year statute of limitations and four years to file a lawsuit. Prior to this California was one of only four states that had a one year statute of limitations. \r\n\r\n</p><p>This law changed in 2002 allowing plaintiffs to have an extra year under the statute of limitations to file personal injury lawsuits. Another reason for the decline in personal injury lawsuits could be seen in the California Highway Patrol data that shows the roadways in California have seen less injuries and deaths in recent years. Injury accidents in 202 were 205,223 and total injuries were 310,689. In 2008 there was an approximate 16 percent drop in collisions and injuries dropped approximately 22 percent. \r\n\r\n</p><p><a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/pages/4092/san-francisco-personal-injury-attorney.htm" title="San Francisco personal injury attorney">San Francisco personal injury attorney</a>, Michael Ehline, stated one of the reasons for this drop in accident injuries could be due to improvements in safety, including the wearing of seatbelts and automotive safety equipment.

aS'<p>\r\nTV Development Contracts refer to TV Networks or other sources of funding election of Independent Producers to DEVELOP a costly or risky TV program for a focus group before committing their resources even to a pilot. Such development by independent producers transcends writing a treatment to computing budgets, selection of cast and locations and even testing the program before a focus group. Let us further explore the Development contract and its intricacies from both the Network and Independent Producer\'s perspectives, to some extent.\r\n</p><p><b>1. <i>SOME </i>CONTRACTUAL CAVEATS ON SCOPE OF AGREEMENT, AS A WHOLE</b></p><p>It is incumbent on both Independent Producer and Network to jointly, among other things:</p><ul><li>Delineate any schedules to be completed by a particular date</li><li>Delineate any audience to be targeted </li><li>Delineate any marketable issues and its budgetary limitations</li><li>Delineate any approval process over costs</li><li>Delineate any practical mechanism to overcome budget overruns </li><li>Delineate any corporate producer to have a fully valid and enforceable contract with the independent producer the network desires to work. This is important as Networks usually select a particular independent producer based on her applicable expertise and insight in a particular risky and costly project</li><li>Delineate any delivery materials with specificity such as the number of pages of proposals, its content, the testing and its geographic, location, the length of such testing and number of individuals in a focus group, among other things.</li></ul><b><p>2. <i>SOME </i>CONTRACTUAL CAVEATS ON INDEPENDENT PRODUCER\'S FUTURE IN THE PROJECT </p></b><p><b></b></p><p>It is incumbent upon both Network and Independent Producer to intelligently decide, to the extent possible, on the future of Independent Producer, if the Development is successful and the Network decides to proceed with a TV series based on the Development material. There are, in fact, some conflicting interests as Network might desire to reduce costs by utilizing in-house personnel including TV Series producer and the Independent Producer vying for the ultimate bounty namely producing the Series. Here are SOME CAVEATS:</p><ul><li>To protect both Network and Independent Producer\'s rights, often, the Development Contract should set out some reasonable intelligent terms for Independent Producer to completely satisfy. Upon complete satisfaction of such terms, then the independent producer has a LIMITED term to produce the TV Series based on the Development materials.</li><li>Alternatively, in situations where the TV Network does not intend to make the Independent Producer the Executive Producer, it might want to add an Buy Out provision which enables the Network to pay a lump sum in exchange for Executive Producer role.</li></ul><b>3. <i>SOME</i> CONTRACTUAL CAVEATS ON INDEPENDENT PRODUCER\'S PAYMENT AND OWNERSHIP RIGHTS</b><p><b></b></p><p><b></b></p><p>Generally, there is no set payment amount designated for a particular Development. In fact, the amount of payment depends on myriad of factors including but not limited to the simplicity or complexity of a Development, to industry recognition or attachments to the Development. In most cases, Networks seek to only cover Independent Producer\'s reasonable, and sometimes unreasonable, costs and defer payment of any profits if a Series is to be produced and whether such Series is profitable. Undoubtedly, the definition of &quot;profitable\' is vague and elusive. </p><p>Here is another Caveat:</p><ul><li>Payment, regardless of its amount, is divided in two or more installments. Often, a simple $10,000 Development fee is paid in two installments while a $100,000 fee for a complex project with disparate scripts and budgets is paid in several installment concomitant with designated thresholds. </li></ul><b>4. <i>SOME </i>CONTRACTUAL CAVEATS ON OWNERSHIP OF DEVELOPMENT WORK&#160; </b><p><b></b><b></b></p><p /><p>Usually, the TV Network funding the Development work is the one owning it, but not all the time. In fact, in the following situations, Independent Producer might end up owning some of the ownership rights:</p><ul><li>If the TV Network pays the Independent Producer relatively a small payment relative to the complexity of the project, the Independent Producer might be in a position to negotiate for a portion of the rights.</li><li>If the TV Network fails to produce the Series based on the Development within a certain period, then the Independent Producer may be able to purchase back the rights from the network.</li></ul><i><b><a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Doron-F-Eghbali.aspx" target="&#95;blank">DORON EGHBALI</a> </b>is a Partner at the Beverly Hills Offices of <a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/" target="&#95;blank">Law Advocate Group, LLP</a>. <a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Doron-F-Eghbali.aspx" target="&#95;blank">Doron</a> Primarily Practices <a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Practice%20Areas/Business%20Law.aspx" target="&#95;blank">Business</a>, <a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Practice%20Areas/Real&#95;Estate&#95;Law.aspx" target="&#95;blank">Real Estate</a> and <a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Practice%20Areas/Entertainment&#95;Law.aspx" target="&#95;blank">Entertainment L</a></i><a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Practice%20Areas/Entertainment&#95;Law.aspx">aw</a>. <i><a href="http://lawadvocategroup.com/Firm%20Info/Doron-F-Eghbali.aspx" target="&#95;blank">Doron</a> Can Be Reached at: 310-651-3065.

In 2008, California had the highest number of traffic fatalities of all U.S. states.  In Los Angeles County alone, there were nearly 83,000 traffic accidents with 667 of those being fatal, and over 52,000 resulting in non-fatal injuries.  These extreme numbers emphasize the need for automobile drivers and passengers to keep safety in mind at all times.\r\n</p><p>\r\nInjuries to the driver or passengers in a car collision are financially and medically devastating.  Unfortunately, as serious as injuries can be, too few victims take them seriously at the time of the accident.  When there are serious external signs, it doesn&#8217;t even take a doctor to recognize that prompt medical care is needed.  However, many injuries following a car accident aren&#8217;t so obvious according to <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/pages/3140/Auto-Accident-Lawyer-LA.htm">car accident lawyer Los Angeles</a>, Michael P.Ehline, Esq.

Meanwhile, the damage goes unchecked until sometimes it goes too far to be fixed.  All injuries following a car accident should be taken very seriously and attended in a hospital setting.  While these expenses are high and intimidating, the victim can take comfort in knowing that medical testing and treatment can be facilitated immediately if the victim hires a car accident attorney.  </p><p>Attorneys like <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/">car accident lawyer</a>, Michael Ehline, Esq., of Ehline Law Firm PC at 21250 Hawthorne Boulevard #500, Torrance, CA (424) 233-0709, can often facilitate medical testing and care even before the negligent party pays, and in cases where insurance balks or is insufficient.\r\n\r\nMedical costs are not the only financial tolls a victim will suffer following an accident.  Many accidents result in lost work time, expenses for child care if the victim is hospitalized, and sometimes loss ability to work at all or live independently.  They may even result in a lost family member.  </p><p>Many victims of more serious accidents will also require psychological treatment to deal with their trauma and anxiety.\r\n\r\nIf you or your loved one is the victim of a car accident due to another&#8217;s negligence, hiring a car accident attorney can help you not only get the medical care needed immediately, but also receive fair recompense for all losses due to the accident.

He said there has been much discussion lately about the number of policies Citizens might get as an insurer of last resort.&#160; Volume for four types of policies-Coastal Account (formerly High-Risk), sinkhole, older mobile homes, and buildings 50 years or older will likely not decrease, he said.</p><p>Citizens\' average personal lines count per week has jumped to 6,600, which represents a significant increase from the 3,600 per week before the 2011 Hurricane Season began, Mr. Gilroy said.&#160; If the volume continues, Citizens might have as many as 1.48 million to 1.5 million policies by the end of the year, he added.</p><p>Personal Lines Underwriting Director Joe Bouthillier told the Committee that the volume of personal lines applications and endorsements coming in to agents is steady, with more than 169,000 requests for personal lines and 246,000 endorsement requests as of May 2011.</p><p>&quot;We are seeing a slight growth in personal lines, averaging between 20,000 to 25,000 per month,&quot; Mr. Bouthillier said.</p><p>With respect to sinkholes, one key initiative involves changes to the way sinkhole claims are handled.&#160; Citizens is focusing first on four counties - Pasco, Hernando, Pinellas and Hillsborough - which account for 95 percent of the sinkhole claims, he noted.&#160;</p><p>&quot;If they have an endorsement for sinkhole coverage, they will be required to have an inspection before binding,&quot; he explained.</p><p>Stephen Mostella, Director of Commercial Lines Underwriting, said Citizens has added seven underwriter positions, for a total of 37 positions, with 17 in Jacksonville and 20 in Tampa.&#160;&#160;

The pilot program is targeting 2,000 policies, with a priority being commercial residential wind policies valued over $8 million.&#160; Related inspections include securing information on replacement cost, wind mitigation features and general condition of the property.</p><p>Mr. Mostella explained that a committee evaluated the quality and accuracy of appraisals done by licensed and unlicensed appraisers.&#160;

aS"<p>As a lawyer, I am often asked to review contracts of all kinds.&#160; Hopefully, the client is asking me to conduct that review <strong><u>prior to</u></strong> the signing of the written lease contract.&#160; Unfortunately, that is not usually the case, and especially so in the situation of a <strong>residential lease</strong>.&#160; For some reason, clients&#160;fail to send the&#160;residential lease to their attorney, somehow believing that the contract is not subject to negotiation. This post is directed to those &quot;future&quot; tenants&#160;who I hope&#160;will at least consider sending that &quot;form&quot; residential lease to an attorney for review&#160;before&#160;placing their sinature on the document.</p><p>It is impossible to overemphasize the importance of the written lease. Your basic rights and duties, as well as those of your landlord, will be found in the language of the lease (you should never, by the way, rely on an <u>oral lease</u>). Think about it, if the landlord believes you have violated the lease,&#160; the landlord will not only ask you to move, but he will also seek to hold you liable for future rent payments and other damages. With that liability looming, many people&#160;still sign the lease without carefully reading it.&#160; Perhaps it is because the landlord&#160;told them&#160;that it is the &quot;standard&quot; lease form (don't believe them) that everyone signs. That statement alone should cause you concern. <u>Never</u> sign the lease without reading the entire&#160;document and understanding all of its provisions.&#160; This means that in most cases you are going to request a blank form of the lease to review away from the landlord. Once you sign the lease, you will almost always be bound by its terms and you will have lost any chance to change any of&#160;those terms.</p><p>On the other hand, you can modify a lease before you sign it, and almost any&#160;portion of a lease&#160;can be&#160;modified, provided that the landlord agrees to the modification. An attorney knows this and will probably suggest several changes on your behalf.&#160;However, because history tells me you may not seek legal help before you sign the lease, here are my suggestions when you do it on your own:</p><ul><li>first and formost, do not be afraid to request changes that seem reasonable to you - remember, everything is negotiable</li><li>make&#160;all changes in ink and make sure the landlord initials those changes</li><li>DO NOT leave the landlord's office without a copy of the final lease agreement</li><li>changes are often written on a separate page that is then added as an attachment to the lease - if so, both you and the landlord should date and sign that additional page</li><li>anything you want fixed, replaced, or repaired should be requested in writing and placed in the lease&#160;- <u>do not</u> rely on the verbal promise of the landlord to take care of it after you move in </li><li>make sure the lease contains a provision requiring the landlord to repair or remedy any condition that affects your health or safety - NO EXCEPTIONS</li><li>if the landlord has the right to enter the premises under certain circumstances, be sure the lease contains a provision requiring the landlord to leave behind (if you were not there) a document stating the time of entry, the reason for the entry, the person(s) who entered, and the time the person(s) left the premises</li><li>if the landlord mentions some &quot;house rules and regulations&quot; that are not part of the written lease, ask the landlord to write them down and to sign and date the document</li></ul><p>The above suggestions are only some of the numerous items you can neotiate&#160;in a lease.&#160;Remember, the best thing to do is to have the lease reviewed by an attorney <strong><em><u>before you sign</u></em></strong>.&#160; The 2-3 hours of time spent by the attorney can save you thousands of dollars down the road. If you nevertheless&#160;plan to &quot;go it alone,&quot; at least ask me for a copy of the &quot;<em>Tenants' Rights Handbook</em>&quot; published by the Texas Young Lawyers Association.&#160; The publication is free and contains many of the comments contained in this post, as well as numerous other helpful comments.</p><p>Nothing in this post should be considered legal advice.&#160;Let's face it, chances are good that you don't know me and I don't know you. My aim is simple - to provide the reader with some useful, but general information about the topic. Do not rely on any information in this post without some asurance that the material is still current and applicable at the time it is read. If you want a legal opinion that has some teeth, consult your personal lawyer about your particular circumstances. If you don't have a lawyer and like what you see here, perhaps you should contact my law office to determine if I might be a good fit for you. To do so, simply click on my name above and you will be directed to my web site, or you can reach me by telephone at <strong>(713) 626-2221</strong> (messages left during non-business hours will be returned no later than the next business day).

aS'&lt;p&gt;For many years, researchers around the world have been studying the troubling issue of domestic violence and how it affects the people involved, particularly those who are on the receiving end of this type of abuse.&#160; Recently, researchers in Australia conducted a thorough study on how domestic violence affects people in the workplace in that country, and the results are such that the world at large may take notice and consider possibilities in terms of how to handle these situations.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the Australian study asked respondents to answer the question of whether or not they had been the victims of domestic violence within the past year, and of those who responded that they had been subjected to this conduct, approximately half of them admitted that this abuse seriously impacted their ability to work productively.&#160; The specific types of problems that workers in this position encountered included being late for work, being overly tired and being afraid of answering the phone or opening their emails because of the fear of more abusive conduct or threats.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Overall, an estimate that was included with the study&#8217;s results indicated that nearly $500 million was lost in overall economic activity because of employees who suffer from domestic abuse, and many consider this estimate to be extremely conservative.&#160; One of the most basic fears that those who had been abused encountered was the fear of losing their jobs because of substandard performance.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h3&gt;San Diego Domestic Violence Lawyers&lt;/h3&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;While the study discussed above was conducted in Australia, it could clearly be equated with the issues of domestic violence that occur in the United States.&#160; Men and women who are subjected to this abuse tend to react in similar ways and many of the cycles of abuse and threats are also similar regardless of where in the world it occurs.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;If you have been suffering through a cycle of abuse that is never going to end, you need to take that courageous first step towards bringing about an end to this unacceptable conduct.&#160; Seek the help of &lt;a title=&quot;San Diego domestic violence lawyers&quot; href=&quot;http://www.scottfamilylaw.net/&quot;&gt;San Diego domestic violence lawyers&lt;/a&gt; who have helped many people put this suffering behind them.&#160; Contact the law office of &lt;strong&gt;James D.

In general, annuities fall into two categories: Deferred and Income.&#160; And each functions quite differently.</p><p class="MsoNoSpacing"><strong>Tax-Deferred Annuities</strong></p><p class="MsoNoSpacing">Tax deferred annuities can be great for increasing your retirement savings for some people because unlike 401(k)s or IRAs, there are no contribution limits.&#160; In addition, earnings continue to compound over time tax free.&#160; However, you better be sure that you do not intend to take money out of the annuity before age 59 1/2, or the IRS will hit you with a whopping 10% penalty.&#160; Also keep in mind that most annuities come with an annual fee not usually found in mutual funds.&#160; Be sure you understand all of the fees, costs and other characteristics of the annuity before you invest.</p><ul><li><div class="MsoNoSpacing">Deferred Fixed Annuities are generally more suitable for conservative investors and those looking to protect their nest eggs because they offer a guaranteed rate of return with lower risk.&#160; However, remember that annuities are not FDIC-insured as you would find in a typical CD.</div></li><div class="MsoNoSpacing"></div><li><div class="MsoNoSpacing">Deferred Variable Annuities are more high-risk and potentially dangerous than fixed annuities because they typically involve more market risk/exposure and can result in losses if the underlying investment funds were to decrease. </div></li></ul><p class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /><strong>Income Annuities</strong></p><p class="MsoNoSpacing">Income annuities are generally better for investors who are already retired or very close to it because they offer income for either life or a set period of time.&#160; Remember though that is most cases, you have little or no access to the money used to purchase income annuities.</p><ul><li><div class="MsoNoSpacing">Fixed Income Annuities are generally the safest choice for investors because they offer a guaranteed and predictable payment for life or fixed period of time and are typically not affected by volatility in the market.&#160; Not only does this help shield your investment from market risk, but it also can help you plan for retirement better since you know exactly what you will be receiving each month.</div></li><div class="MsoNoSpacing"></div><li><div class="MsoNoSpacing">Deferred Fixed Income Annuities are the same as fixed income in regards to less risk, there is just a deferral period before the payments begin, which can result in a higher income payout.</div></li><div class="MsoNoSpacing"></div><li><div class="MsoNoSpacing">Immediate Variable Income Annuities are generally more risky because while some amount of payout is guaranteed, that amount will be subject to the volatility of the market and the performance of the underlying investments.&#160; While there is the potential for greater growth if the market does well, there is also the potential for loss if the market does poorly.</div></li></ul><p class="MsoNoSpacing"><br />The bottom line is that as with any other investment, there are pros and cons to investing in annuities and they are somewhat complicated.&#160; Do your homework and understand exactly what type of annuity you are being offered and what risks and fees are associated with it.&#160; These disclosures should always be provided in the annuity prospectus provided to you before you invest.&#160; Be sure to read it, and be sure to ask your broker to explain it to you in detail before investing.&#160; If you are still unsure, you may want to consider seeking a second opinion.&#160; </p><p class="MsoNoSpacing">The foregoing is not investment advice, and should not be relied upon for making investment decisions.&#160; Contact your financial advisor for specific advice, recommendations and information specific to your situation.&#160; If you think that you have been the victim of annuity or other investment fraud, contact <a href="http://www.securities-fraud-attorney-san-diego.com/">Daniel Carlson at the Carlson Law Firm</a> today for a free consultation at 619-544-9300. </p><!--more-->Annuities are popular investment vehicles.

aS'<p>Due to disparities that must be calculated, investors in shipping funds may have to wait a long time before benefitting from expected tax savings.</p><p>GRP Rainer Lawyers and Tax Advisors in Cologne, Berlin, Bonn, Bremen, Dusseldorf, Essen, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich, Nuremberg, Stuttgart and London www.grprainer.com/en conclude: The tax advantages investors have come to expect will materialize only at the end of their investment period. Yet often, investors can face the problem that the disparity will show only at the end of the investment term. Quite often, investors are surprised when they realize that taxes can be demanded retroactively.<br /><br />Whether an investor will face a gain or a loss is determined by whether the disparity is negative or positive. In any event, investors will be facing a general obligation to pay taxes, regardless of the result of the disparity.<br /><br />The difference between the book value of a ship and its going concern value is the disparity. It is also calculated from the tonnage tax which determines the taxable income. The tonnage tax is due at the end of each shipping investment period.<br /><br />During the preliminary consideration whether an investment in a shipping fund is appropriate for an investor, the disparity should always be taken into account. If the disparity is disregarded, investors may be facing a high amount of retroactively payable taxes. Thus, the expected tax advantages can be quickly wiped out by immense back taxes.<br /><br />Expected tax advantages can go completely up in smoke due to the negative results of the disparity. Such a case can occur when an investor did not adequately prepare for a possible demand of retroactive taxes.<br /><br />In particular, this also applies to investors who have had their shipping investment financed by a foreign currency loan. These are not safe from the disparity either. They result in a disparity due to the different currency exchange rates that existed at the beginning and the end of the term. The taxable disparity results from the sum of disparities for the ship and for the loan.<br /><br />Investors who are planning to invest in shipping should at an early time look for a lawyer who is experienced in tax law to avoid being negatively surprised by the result of disparity.<br /><br />http://www.grprainer.com/en/Tax-Law.html</p>'

aS'<p>A case is now before the 9th Circuit <a href="http://www.endbillcollections.com">Bankruptcy</a> Appellate Panel, Mullen v. Hamlin, BAP No. 11-1083 to determine the issue as to whether an inherited IRA is exempt pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167;522(b)(3), 11 U.S.C &#167;522(d)(12) and limited to $1,095,000 by 11 USC &#167; 522n. To date the majority of courts that have ruled on this issue have held in favor of allowing the exemption. Footnote 1.</p><p>In the majority of cases the opinion has rested on a plain language reading of 11 U.S.C. &#167;522(d)(12) which imposes two requirements before the debtor may claim an exemption under that section: (1) the amount the debtor seeks to exempt must be retirement funds; and (2) the retirement funds must be in an account exempt from taxation under one of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. In their opinions these courts have concluded that both conditions are met with respect to an inherited IRA account.</p><p>The trustee appellant in Mullen v. Hamlin is trying to overturn the decision of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Arizona. The trustees argument is based on a since overturned ruling from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Texas in In re Chilton, 426 B.R. 612 (Bankr. E.D. Tex. 2011). The judge in Chilton ruled that inherited IRAs are not protected in bankruptcy because the funds in an inherited IRA &#8220;are not funds intended for retirement purposes.&#8221; As evidence of that, the judge pointed out that under Internal Revenue Service rules governing inherited IRAs, debtor Janice Chilton, who is turning 52, would have to either begin taking annual distributions from the $170,000 IRA she inherited from her mom this year, or deplete the entire IRA by 2013. (By contrast, there are elaborate IRS rules limiting when you can take money out of your own IRA. Chilton has since been overruled by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Chilton v. Moser, 2011 WL 938310.</p><p>We believe that it is highly likely that the 9th Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel will follow the majority and uphold the &#167;522(d)(12) exemption as made applicable to opt out states like California pursuant to &#167;522(b)(3). Stay tuned.</p><p>1. In re Nessa, 426 B.R. 312 (8th Cir. BAP 2010), In re Tabor, 433 B.R. 469 (Bankr. M.D. Pa. 2010), Bierbach v. Tabor, No. 10-cv-1580 (M.D. Pa.

aS"<p>Words are peculiar animals; they are meant to convey meanings through stringing together, creating conceptual models, images, descriptive thoughts.&#160; Thus, one would think that the greater quantity of words would lead to a greater level of thoughts conveyed, images created, etc.&#160; However, what often happens (a commond mistake found in unrepresented applicants who file for disability retirement under FERS &amp; CSRS) is that there is a 'fatigue factor' by the reader:&#160; in this case, the reviewing person at the Office of Personnel Management.&#160; People often either overstate his or her medical disability, or tend to think that pages and pages of a stream-of-consciousness narrative about one's medical conditions will persuade the reviewer of the seriousness of the medical condition.&#160; Neither are necessary.&#160; Let the medical condition itself speak to the seriousness.&#160; The applicant does not need to overstate it; and a voluminous narrative only points out and emphasizes a suspicion that there is some underlying reason as to why you feel the need to explain yourself so much.&#160; Use of words is a 'balancing act' -- using the right words; explaining the right amount; creating the right string of thoughts and images.&#160; An effective disability retirement application must find the right balance of all of these elements.</p><p>Sincerely, Robert R.

aS'<p>A recent survey states that 20 percent of truck drivers nationwide admitted to falling asleep at the wheel in a given month. This stat comes at no surprise to our truck accident attorneys, who frequently handle horrible truck crash cases, caused when fatigued truckers continue driving over the legal limits. This is usually due to intense pressure by management, as well as financial incentives to drive past federally regulated hours of service.</p><p>It&#8217;s against the law. And it&#8217;s incredibly dangerous to fall asleep when driving an 80,000 pound tractor-trailer on the public roadways.</p><p>Under 49 CFR &#167; 392.3, no driver shall operate a commercial motor vehicle, and a motor carrier shall not require or permit a driver to operate a commercial motor vehicle, while the driver&#8217;s ability or alertness is so impaired as to make it unsafe for him to operate the truck.</p><p>Obviously, a truck driver will never tell you he was too &#8220;fatigued&#8221; to have been behind the wheel during his deposition. But a series of questions regarding the driver&#8217;s medical condition or recent food and beverage purchases can determine whether or not he was operating a commercial truck while ill or fatigued.</p>Sample Deposition Questions for the Tired Truck Driver<ol><li>Within the 48 hours preceding the accident, where did you stop to eat?</li><li>What did you have to eat?</li><li>Did you experience an upset stomach later? Did you feel any nausea? Diarrhea?</li><li>If so, did you pull off the road?</li><li>How long did you wait before returning to driving?</li><li>Did you have any coffee or tea? Any energy drinks? Any other caffeinated beverages?</li><li>How many of these caffeinated beverages did you consume within the last 12 hours leading up to the accident?</li><li>Were you taking any medications at the time of the accident?</li><li>What conditions were those medications treating?</li><li>Where those conditions disclosed during your physical? Would they appear on your medical certificate?</li></ol><p>Many of these questions could be answered upon inspection of the truck or the driver&#8217;s supporting documents if your spoliation requests and temporary restraining orders are filed soon after the date of the accident.

aS'<p>&#160;&#160; &#160; There is, of course, the &quot;psychology&quot; of the process of filing for disability retirement benefits. The term itself (psychology, psychological) is all too often misused. &#160;All that is meant in this context is that, at each stage of the process (the initial application stage; the Second, Reconsideration Stage; the Third, Merit Systems Protection Board Stage; the fourth &amp; fifth stages of an appeal, either for a Petition for Full Review or an appeal to the Federal Circuit, or sequentially), the applicant should have a general idea of the level of people the Applicant is dealing with. &#160;Thus, for example, at the initial stage of the process, one should not expect the OPM Representative to be fully conversant in the law; whereas, if the case gets to the Merit Systems Protection Board Stage, the OPM representative is fairly well-versed in multiple aspects of the laws governing disability retirement. &#160;Additionally, the level of medical knowledge varies from one OPM representative to the next. &#160;This is not to say that each stage of the process requires a greater level of intellectual input or information; nor does it mean that each stage should be &quot;tailored&quot; based upon the expected level of competence. &#160;Rather, an awareness of what to expect, how to respond, and what level of intellectual responsiveness are all necessary ingredients in preparing and filing a successful disability retirement application. In short, it is important to know the &quot;psychology&quot; of it all.</p><p>Sincerely, Robert R. McGill, Esquire</p>'

aS'<p class=" ">Under the majority &#8220;American Rule,&#8221;\r\nparties are generally required to bear their own attorney&#8217;s fees in civil cases.&#160; For over 100 years, however, Texas has been in\r\nthe minority that allows courts to award attorney&#8217;s fees to prevailing parties\r\nfor certain claims, such as for breach of oral or written contracts.&#160; In 1986, the Legislature changed the language\r\ndescribing those who could be liable for attorney&#8217;s fees from &#8220;person or corporation&#8221;\r\nto &#8220;individual or corporation.&#8221; &#160;By adopting\r\nthis more restrictive meaning, it could be said that Texas was becoming more\r\n&#8220;American&#8221; in its view of fee shifting statutes</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">Section 38.001of the Texas Civil Practice\r\n&amp; Remedies Code currently governs the award of attorney&#8217;s fees in certain\r\ncivil cases and specifically provides that &#8220;[a] person may recover reasonable\r\nattorney&#8217;s fees from an <b>individual or\r\ncorporation </b>&#8230;&#8221; While the issue of who and what should be included within\r\nthe scope of &#167; 38.001 as an &#8220;individual or corporation&#8221; has not been addressed\r\nby the Texas Supreme Court, other Texas courts have adopted a narrow\r\ninterpretation based on legislative history of &#167; 38.001. &#160;Article 2226 of the Texas Revised Civil\r\nStatutes, the predecessor statute to &#167; 38.001, provided that &#8220;any person,\r\ncorporation, partnership, or other legal entity&#8221; may seek attorneys fees from\r\nsuch &#8220;<b>person or corporation</b>.&#8221; &#160;The reviser&#8217;s notes to &#167; 38.001 indicate that\r\nthe drafters chose not to use &#8216;person&#8217; to identify those against whom\r\nattorney&#8217;s fees may be recovered because of the broadness of the definition of\r\n&#8216;person&#8217; in the Code Construction Act. &#160;As\r\none Texas court said, &#8220;the legislature changed the terminology used to describe\r\nthose liable for attorney&#8217;s fees under &#167; 38.001 from &#8216;person or corporation&#8217; to\r\n&#8216;individual or corporation&#8217; in order to retain a more restrictive meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">To be sure, there are numerous cases in\r\nwhich awards of &#167; 38.001 attorney&#8217;s fees against entities other than\r\ncorporations have been upheld, but none of those cases addressed the statutory\r\nrevision.&#160; Those courts that have\r\nspecifically addressed the change in language between Art. 2226 and &#167; 38.001,\r\nhowever, have interpreted it as limiting the coverage of the statute to exclude\r\nits applicability to business entities that are not corporations. &#160;For example, in <i>Ganz v. Lyons P&#8217;ship, L.P</i>., 173 F.R.D. 173, 176 (N.D. Tex. 1997), the Northern District of Texas concluded\r\nthat partnerships do not fall under the &#8220;individual or corporation&#8221; language in\r\n&#167; 38.001. &#160;The Court emphasized the fact\r\nthat &#8220;person&#8221; as used in the Code Construction Act included partnerships and\r\nthe legislature specifically eliminated the inclusion of &#8220;person&#8221; in &#167; 38.001\r\nbecause it was too broad. &#160;Thus, by\r\nchanging the phrase from &#8220;person or corporation&#8221; to &#8220;individual or corporation&#8221;\r\nthe legislature specifically intended to eliminate partnerships and other\r\nnon-corporate entities from the purview of the statute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">More recently, the Northern District of\r\nTexas held that a self-funded and self-administered welfare benefit trust fund\r\nwas not an &#8220;individual or corporation&#8221; under &#167; 38.001 and, therefore, was not\r\nliable for attorney&#8217;s fees.&#160; <i>Baylor\r\nHealth Care Systems v. National Elevator Indus. Health Benefit Plan</i>, 2008 WL 2245834 (N.D. Tex. 2008).&#160; Relying on statutory interpretation\r\nprinciples and legislative history, the Court attempted to determine how the\r\nTexas Supreme Court might rule on the issue and ultimately predicted that the\r\nTexas Supreme Court would likely find &#167; 38.001&#8217;s language is unambiguous and thus\r\nthe term &#8220;individual&#8221; should not be interpreted to include entities previously\r\ncovered as &#8220;persons&#8221; under Article 2226.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">We won&#8217;t have a definitive answer on\r\nwhether entities other than &#8220;corporations&#8221; can be held liable for attorney&#8217;s\r\nfees until either the Texas Supreme Court addresses the issue or the\r\nLegislature amends the statute.&#160; Until\r\nthen, practitioners should take a close look at the entity against whom\r\nattorney&#8217;s fees are being sought and whether that entity is a &#8220;corporation.&#8221;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=" ">P.S.&#160;\r\nThe Texas Business Organization Code defines &#8220;corporation&#8221; as &#8220;an entity governed as a corporation under Title 2\r\n[corporations] or 7 [professional entities].&#160;\r\nThe term includes a for-profit corporation, nonprofit corporation, and\r\nprofessional corporation.&#8221;&#160; Tex.

There were 29 victims who were injured and one killed in DUI car crashes that occurred. </p><p>There were 8 people injured in bicycle accidents, five deaths resulting from auto accidents, and 13 injured as well as two fatalities due to pedestrian accidents.

aS'In many cases where you&#8217;ve been hurt in a car accident, and in almost all serious workers&#8217; compensation cases, you will be required to submit to what&#8217;s called an independent medical exam. It often goes by its initials &#8211; IME.<br /><br />There are a couple of things you need to know before you go for an IME. First and most important: This medical exam is anything but independent. The doctor you will see has been hired and paid for by the insurance company. Second, while you will never hear anyone say it, the purpose of an IME is to have the doctor to write a report for the insurer that minimizes your injuries, to says that the treatment you&#8217;ve had wasn&#8217;t necessary or pre-existing, or to give the insurer an excuse to limit the amount of care you need. The insurance company will use that report to try to reduce how much money they have to pay you &#8211; or to deny your claim entirely.<br /><br />And last, an IME isn&#8217;t the end of the world. As a Colorado auto accident attorney, I can tell you that this is one of the biggest ploys insurers use to try to fatten their bottom lines. We&#8217;ve seen this tactic many times, and we know how to fight it.

aS'<p>In the view of the Federal Supreme Court [BGH], the value of real estate appropriately used is not to be taken into account when calculating the assets of persons responsible for the upkeep of their parents.</p><p>GRP Rainer Lawyers and Tax Advisors in Cologne, Berlin, Bonn, Bremen, Dusseldorf, Essen, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich, Nuremberg, Stuttgart and London &#8211; www.grprainer.com/en conclude: In a decision of August 7, 2013 (File number XII ZB 269/12), the Federal Supreme Court ruled that the value of real estate used appropriately as a family home is not to be taken into account when the assets of persons responsible for the upkeep of their parents are calculated, since they cannot be expected to liquidate the property.<br /><br />In the case at hand, the defendant&#8217;s mother is living in a senior nursing home but cannot pay the cost alone; the petitioner therefore had granted her social assistance. However, the petitioner was then requesting reimbursement, and the question was whether the defendant was responsible for paying support based on his income or his assets.<br /><br />The Municipal Court (AG) had ordered the defendant to pay an amount of support which the Superior Court (OLG) had calculated, partly on the basis of income and benefits from a family home and the 50% ownership in a house in Italy, since this did not exceed the amount of personal assets to which the defendant is entitled for self-support. The OLG first dismissed the petition for support, but at the petitioner&#8217;s request dismissed his entire petition, following which the latter filed an appeal.<br /><br />The BGH dismissed the appealed judgment and referred the case back to the OLG. The reason given by the BHG was that the defendant&#8217;s net income had been calculated in error, that while in principle, children are obligated to include the core of their assets when their obligation to support their parents is calculated, the children&#8217;s own obligations must also be accounted for, that their own livelihood must not be endangered, and that in particular the debts they owe for support must not jeopardize their provision for their own old age. That is what the BGH ruled.<br /><br />The BGH also decided that the value of an appropriately used family home must be disregarded, since it cannot be expected that children obligated to support their parents would have to liquidate such property. Neither should they have to pay support based on the core of their assets if their other assets do not exceed 5% of the gross income during the rest of their working life to protect provision for their own old age.<br /><br />The BGH also found that their own obligations had been miscalculated, and that the OLG had disregarded travelling expenses for visiting the mother, which can be deducted because in the BGH&#8217;s opinion, such visits fulfil a moral obligation that must be recognized in support law and should be taken into account.<br /><br />Whether dealing with a marriage contract, a divorce, or support &#8211; in family law, it is an advantage to consult a lawyer who will represent your interests appropriately.<br /><br />http://www.grprainer.com/en/Family-Law.html</p>'

aS'<p>One of the reasons that people allow an insurance company to avoid paying out a fair settlement after a serious car accident is because the victim and his family are unfamiliar with how the settlement process works. If you become the victim of a serious car accident, then you need to have someone on your side that understands the process and has experience in getting the results that you need. A car accident attorney is going to be able to help you get the financial settlement you need to pick up the pieces of your life and get back on your feet. It takes experience to know what information a court needs to hear to rule in favor of an accident victim. That is the kind of experience you are looking for with a good lawyer.</p>\r\n<p>A car accident attorney is going to collect all of the information necessary to re-create the accident and get all of the responsible parties involved. Your lawyer will collect names, dates and a long list of other pieces of information that will help to put together the facts on what really happened. Then the courts will get to see how responsible the other party was in the accident and why the insurance company should be responsible for your medical bills. It is a comprehensive process that must be done correctly for it to be effective.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes insurance companies can get out of paying the victim of an accident a just settlement by claiming that the victim had something to do with causing the accident. A <a href="http://www.getmejustice.com/">Sarasota car accident attorney</a> will bring together police reports and other official information that will deny the insurance company this loophole and make the insurance company pay for the damage its client has done. You should not try to stand alone against an insurance company that has experienced lawyers working for it. You should have your own experienced attorney that will make sure your voice is heard.</p>\r\n<p>When the victim is back home and recovering from the accident, there is the question of a fair settlement to compensate for past, present and future lost wages. This is the point where the victim needs an experienced car accident attorney that will collect every piece of information needed to prove that the accident is the source of the victim&#8217;s financial issues. The attorney will work hard to make sure that the victim gets the settlement he needs to bring his life back together.</p><!--more-->One of the reasons that people allow an insurance company to avoid \r\npaying out a fair settlement after a serious car accident is because the\r\n victim and his family are unfamiliar with how the settlement process \r\nworks. If you become the victim of a serious car accident, then you need\r\n to have someone on your side that understands the process and has \r\nexperience in getting the results that you need.'

aS'Most people have heard of a whiplash injury but may not understand exactly what qualifies as a whiplash injury or how to know if they have suffered one. Only a licenses physician can properly diagnose any injury, but understanding what whiplash is and what commons symptoms of a whiplash injury are may help you decide whether or not you need to be evaluated by a physician.  When in doubt head to the doctor for a check-up!\r\n\r\nWhiplash is a general, non-medical term, that refers to a wide range of injuries to the neck. Your neck is where the top of the spine is located. Bones, tendons, ligaments and muscles are all found within the neck. Our spine, while an incredibly strong structure for its size, is not immune from injury. When your neck is thrown backward or forward at an unusually high rate of speed and/or with unusual force the ligaments, tendons and muscles in your neck can be stretched and pulled beyond their normal range of motion. Not surprisingly, the most common cause of a whiplash injury is a car accident. Even a slow speed car accident can have a sever impact on your neck and/or spine. The reason for this is that in a car accident your head is frequently thrown violently back and forth. In some cases your head may even connect with the steering wheel, the window or the head rest potentially making the injury worse. \r\n\r\nOne of the most frustrating things about a whiplash injury is that in most cases it will not present symptoms until a day or two after the actual accident that caused the injury. Unfortunately this means that many victims do not seek an immediate medical evaluation which only delays treatment. Common symptoms of a whiplash injury include soreness, pain and stiffness in your neck, headaches, blurred vision, dizziness and fatigue. Whiplash victims may also experience ringing in the ears, memory problems, fatigue or trouble sleeping and difficulty concentrating. Not all victims experience all symptoms. Each person reacts to a whiplash injury in a unique manner as each accident is unique. In addition, because a whiplash injury does not always present symptoms immediately it is vital that anyone involved in a personal injury accident seek medical attention and have a thorough evaluation to diagnose any and all injuries. While whiplash injuries generally heal within a few weeks, some injuries can have lasting effects and the sooner you begin treatment the better your chance of avoiding a long-term injury.\r\n\r\nIf you think you have suffered a whiplash injury, after seeking medical attention you should consult with an experienced whiplash injury attorney. In California, the victim of a whiplash injury is entitled to compensation for those injuries. The California whiplash injury law firm of Ledger & Associates has been representing whiplash injury victims for over a decade. If you would like to schedule a free and detailed evaluation of your potential whiplash injury case, please contact the attorneys at The Law Offices Ledger & Associates by calling 1-800-300-0001 or visit them online at <a href="http://www.ledgerlaw.com/">www.ledgerlaw.com</a>.<!--more-->If you would like to schedule a free and \r\ndetailed evaluation of your potential whiplash injury case, please \r\ncontact the attorneys at The Law Offices Ledger &amp; Associates by calling 1-800-300-0001 or\r\n visit them online at www.ledgerlaw.com.'

aS'<p>Motorcycle accident victims have rights in San Diego to hold the driver accountable that has caused the collision that resulted in the injuries. These injuries can be traumatic head injuries that might cause a permanent disability, there could be internal injuries, neck and spinal cord injuries, cuts gashes and scrapes that result in severe scaring. Then on top of the injuries, there is the fact that while healing it is not possible to work and that means a loss of wages, along with hospital and other medical bills piling up. </p><p>\r\nThe facts are clear when it involves motorcycle riders, every year when the statistics are seen and studies like the Hurt Report that was conducted at the University of Southern California and funded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This study shows that three-quarters of the motorcycle accidents that happen are collisions, which involves a vehicle. Usually you will be searching for <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/pages/3140/Auto-Accident-Lawyer-LA.htm">car accident attorneys</a>, but you may need something more.</p><p>In two-thirds of these motorcycle accidents there is proof that the motorist in the vehicle failed to yield to the right of way to the motorcyclist. What this shows is that motorcycle riders cannot be careful enough when on the roads, because drivers do not always drive alert to motorcycles rights on the roadway. \r\nAfter a motorcycle accident it can be an extremely stressful time financially and this can slow the healing process. The motorcycle accident victims have rights in San Diego, which means that they can legally hold the negligent driver that caused the accident accountable. </p><p>The most successful way of doing this is by having the representation of a motorcycle accident lawyer. This is because they understand <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/">motorcycle accidents</a> and they have the resources to build a winning legal case against the driver that caused the collision and the rider to be injured. This is important, because not only will the driver be accountable for their actions, but also the driver&#8217;s insurance company. The insurance company will have attorneys representing them, in which they will fight to keep the insurance company from having to paying compensation to the injured motorcycle rider. </p><p>The resources that the <a href="http://losangelesmotorcycleaccidentlawyers.blogspot.com/">motorcycle accident attorney</a> has that they can use in proving that the injured motorcyclist has the right to compensation will include experts. They will be aggressive in handling the legal claim and this is something that the attorney without motorcycle accident experience might not be able to do against the insurance company lawyers. \r\n\r\n</p><!--more-->The resources that the motorcycle accident attorney\r\n has that they can use in proving that the injured motorcyclist has the \r\nright to compensation will include experts.

aS'<p>Lately I am much enamored of reading American history, particularly the era in which our Founding Fathers lived.&#160; I have enjoyed immensely two biographies, the first about Benjamin Franklin written by Walter Isaacson, the second a Pulitzer Prize-winning book about John Adams by David McCullough who also penned the marvelous &#8220;1776.&#8221;&#160; These biographies provide the reader with insight regarding the enormous trials faced by our great American patriots who risked their lives in founding a nation.</p><p>Our War of Independence from Great Britain also gave rise to two immortal, inspirational documents that have seldom met their match:&#160; The Declaration of Independence (1776) and The Constitution of the United States of America (1787).&#160; Who can fail to be moved by the elegant prose and majestic ideas of these two quintessential American works?</p><p>As an immigration lawyer I am called upon often to assist foreign nationals in applying for U.S. citizenship through the naturalization process.&#160; When a lawful permanent resident alien changes status from permanent residence, i.e., green card holder, to U.S. citizenship, it is, from my experience, one of that person&#8217;s proudest days.&#160; My parents were naturalized citizens, and although they are deceased, I would never think of discarding their original certificates of naturalization or their U.S. passport(s).&#160; They are sacred documents to me.</p><p>&#160;The naturalization process is as old as the U.S. Constitution itself.&#160; Article 1, Section 8 lists the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization as one of the enumerated powers of Congress.&#160; But what rules or guidance could Congress turn to in 1787 in adopting a uniform rule of naturalization that could be fairly applied within the framework and context of colonial society?</p><p>The first law enacted by Congress dealing with the granting of national citizenship was the United States Naturalization Law of March 26, 1790.&#160; This law limited naturalization to immigrants who were &#8220;free white persons&#8221; of &#8220;good moral character.&#8221;&#160;&#160; By limiting citizenship to &#8220;free whites,&#8221; Congress, in deference to the times, left out indentured servants (white or black), slaves, free blacks and later Asians.&#160; Women, however, were included in the Act.</p><p>The &#8220;good moral character&#8221; requirement, interestingly, has been maintained to the present day, albeit in a different form.&#160; The 1790 Act required two years of residence in the United States and one year in the state of residence prior to applying for naturalization.&#160; A specified period of residence was necessary to help the courts decide whether good moral character existed.&#160; The Naturalization Act of 1795 extended the residence requirement to five years.&#160; Today in determining good moral character, Section 316 of the Immigration and Nationality Act says that the Attorney General, acting through the USCIS, may look beyond the five year period immediately preceding the filing of the application in assessing the applicant&#8217;s good moral character.</p><p>The adoption in 1868 of The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution granted citizenship to all persons born within the United States (excluding non-taxed Indians who were granted citizenship in the 1920&#8217;s).&#160; The invidious laws that unfairly prevented persons of various nationalities, e.g., Asians, from becoming naturalized were eventually repealed, and in 1952 all racial and gender discrimination in naturalization was thankfully prohibited.</p>We have our Founding Fathers to thank for the concept of a fair and uniform naturalization law embedded in our Constitution.&#160; This guiding principle, that all foreign nationals who become lawful permanent residents, can qualify to become U.S. citizens and be treated as equals under our laws and by their American compatriots, is one of the reasons that the United States of America is a very special place indeed.

aS'<p class="MsoNormal">There have been multiple accidents involving school buses\r\nthis past spring, leaving many parents asking why seat belts are not required\r\non school buses. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">By Federal and State law, seat belts are not required in\r\nbuses weighing over 10,000 pounds. Since 2009 however, federal law has required\r\nlap and shoulder restraints in new buses under 10,000 pounds. These are\r\ntypically small vehicles made to seat only 10-14 students. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Currently, the National Highway Traffic Safety\r\nAdministration (NHTSA) reports that in larger buses, the spacing and height of\r\nthe seats offer crash protection through &#8220;compartmentalization.&#8221; Compartmentalization,\r\nusing of higher seat backs, protects students from being propelled over a seat.\r\nHowever, it doesn&#8217;t prevent injuries in front or rear-impact collisions, and\r\nonly offers limited protection in other crashes. Furthermore, this crash\r\nprotection assumes that all children will sit properly in their seats, facing\r\nforward, with their feet on the ground, and unfortunately all too often that\r\nisn&#8217;t the case. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Since the tragic IPS school bus accident on March 12<sup>th</sup>\r\n2012 that killed the bus driver and a 5-year-old passenger, there has been a\r\nrenewed debate on whether seat belts on school buses should be mandatory. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">The average life span of a school bus is 10-15 years. Limited\r\nmeasures have been taken to improve bus safety, including increasing the height\r\nof seat backs from 20 to 24 inches on new buses. However, school systems financially\r\ncannot retire old buses just because of lower seat backs. Furthermore, many\r\nSchool Boards argue they cannot afford to implement safety belts in their\r\nbusses. New buses with safety belts cost about $10,000 more than older models\r\nwithout safety belts. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Others believe that regardless of seat belts or not, the\r\nbehavior of students on buses needs to be a component. Teaching the importance\r\nof sitting properly in school bus seats can be life saving for children. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">From our perspective, school systems have a responsibility\r\nto take reasonable safety measures to protect our own children when they are\r\nbeing transported to and from school. It will be interesting to see how the\r\nschool bus seat belt debate plays out over the course of the year as more\r\nattention is being focused on school bus safety.

aS'&#160;&#160;&#160;<p class="MsoNormal">I am sharing with you another true story.&#160; Francisco, a Filipino citizen, was only 17 years old when his parents immigrated to the United States.&#160; Francisco was given specific instruction by his parents that he should not get married lest he forfeits the opportunity to immigrate to the United States and to make a better life for himself.&#160; Francisco&#8217;s mother petitioned for him as soon as she became a green card holder or a legal permanent resident.&#160; A year later, Francisco met Veronica, a seventeen-year-old provincial lass of Tarlac.&#160; They fell in love after a few weeks of dating.&#160; Their passion clouded their judgment and soon enough, they are faced with the specter of having a child when they are barely young adults themselves.&#160; When Veronica&#8217;s parents found out of her pregnancy, they were outraged.&#160; They live in a very small, conservative community where everybody knew what was going on in everybody&#8217;s life and where the Catholic notion of premarital sex was an abomination of sorts.&#160; Francisco was torn between his chance of immigrating to the United States and doing the right thing for the love of his life.&#160; When Veronica&#8217;s pregnancy was starting to show, her parents became desperate to save the family&#8217;s reputation.&#160; They exerted pressure on Francisco to marry Veronica.&#160; So he did.&#160; They got married, lived together, and had three children.&#160; Ten years later, Francisco received a notice of interview from the U.S. embassy in Manila.&#160; He and his parents were ecstatic.&#160; At the interview, Francisco stated he was single and did not disclose the fact he has children.&#160; The U.S. embassy issued a visa to Francisco as an unmarried son of a legal permanent resident.</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal">&#160; &#160;&#160;Francisco entered the United States and became a legal permanent resident.&#160; He got a job, paid his taxes, and was never in trouble with the law.&#160; His parents became U.S. citizens, but the father died shortly.&#160; Francisco visited his wife and children every year.&#160; Francisco had two jobs to support his family.&#160; He missed the playful and innocent years of his children and endured a life without the company and love of his wife.&#160; Francisco remained steadfast in his role as head of the family.&#160; He remained faithful to his wife and sent fifty per cent of his earnings to the family.&#160; Francisco couldn&#8217;t wait to be reunited with his family in the United States.&#160; As soon as he gained five years of residency in the United States, he filed for naturalization.&#160; Then the problem started.&#160; The Government found out about the marriage before he entered the United States and initiated removal proceedings against Francisco.&#160; Francisco admitted that he procured his immigrant visa by willfully misrepresenting a material fact, which was the marriage.&#160; He requested relief under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) 237(a)(1)(H), which gives the Immigration Judge (IJ) the discretion to waive the removal of an immigrant who procured a visa through misrepresentation.&#160; Only an alien who is the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident is eligible to apply for this waiver.&#160; The removal proceedings against Francisco dragged on for years.&#160; Francisco&#8217;s mother died before the hearing on Francisco&#8217;s request for INA section 237(a)(1)(H).&#160; At the hearing, the Government counsel stated Francisco was no longer eligible for the waiver because his qualifying relative who was his U.S. citizen mother has died.&#160; The IJ held that Francisco was eligible because he continues to be the son of a U.S. citizen after the death of his U.S. citizen mother.&#160; The IJ then examined a long list of equities in Francisco&#8217;s favor and granted Francisco a waiver. The Government appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).&#160; The BIA interpreted the INA section 237(a)(1)(H) differently.&#160; It sustained the Government&#8217;s appeal, holding that to be eligible for a waiver under this provision, the alien must establish that a qualifying relationship to a living relative.&#160; According to the BIA, because Francisco&#8217;s mother was no longer living, Francisco was no longer eligible to apply for the waiver.&#160; The BIA vacated the IJ&#8217;s decision and ordered Francisco removed to the Philippines.&#160; Francisco appealed to the 9<sup>th</sup> Circuit Court of Appeal.&#160; The 9<sup>th</sup> Circuit said the BIA erred and Francisco is eligible for the waiver.&#160; INA section 237(a)(1)(H) does not state that the qualifying relative must be alive and &#8220;it is not the role of those who enforce and interpret immigration law to impose unilaterally novel substantive requirements beyond those set for in the immigration law itself&#8221;.&#160; It was a happy ending for Francisco.&#160; He was very fortunate the 9<sup>th</sup> circuit ruled in his favor.&#160; Before this decision came out, a lot of aliens were deported because their U.S. citizen parents had passed away when removal proceedings were initiated against them. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p TEXT-ALIGN: left; MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" left">If you have any questions, please feel welcome to email me at <a href="mailto:susan@law-usimmigration.com">susan@law-usimmigration.com</a> or call (619) 819 -8648 to arrange&#160;a telephone consultation.&#160; <p /></p><p TEXT-ALIGN: left; MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" left">San Diego Immigration Attorney - <a href="http://law-usimmigration.com/">http://law-usimmigration.com</a><p /></p><p /><!--more-->On May 19,2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a decision stating that an individual whose mother is a United States citizen continues to be the son of a U.S. citizen even after his mother\'s death.'

aS'<p>Getting injured when inside the cruise ship is quite common. Passengers on cruise ships suffer from injuries of different kinds and the level of harm caused to their body and mind also differs. Filing claims for a cruise ship injury include several rules and is not as simple as filing lawsuits for other kinds of personal injuries. </p><p>As a result, the role of the cruise ship lawyers is extremely significant. Cruise ships lawyers must have extensive knowledge, proper training and several years of experience for handling these accident cases.  \r\n\r\nCruise travel is considered as one of the most secured ways of transportation; but the launch of larger ships (these ships carry almost 5000 people) has led to safety concerns for the passengers. </p><p>If you have sustained an injury after getting involved in a cruise ship accident, you must right away seek legal advice from an experienced cruise ship attorney. He will help you in determining which course you should pursue for protecting your legal rights. A good lawyer specializing on cases of cruise ship accidents will help you in obtaining compensation for the injury you have sustained. \r\n\r\nBefore visiting the lawyer, you must gather as much information as possible related to the injury. </p><p>To explain the case in a better way you can submit statements of the witnesses, photographs of the location of the cruise ship accident. Don&#8217;t forget to carry the bills, medical records as proofs of your injury, boarding passes and documents that show the amount you have already spent for the treatment of the injury. </p><p>Show the attorney the cruise ship contract signed by you, which is mostly on the passenger tickets. Passenger contracts help the attorney in determining the victim&#8217;s legal rights and obligations. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the role of the cruise ship lawyers is extremely crucial in ensuring that the victim obtains the compensation. Go for lawyers who have several years of experience of managing cruise accident cases. Hiring local lawyers is always beneficial. </p><p>Suppose if you are from Sherman Oaks, you should opt for a skilled and qualified Sherman Oaks <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/pages/3251/PracticeAreas&#95;cruise-ship.htm">Ehline cruise ship attorney</a>. He will be familiar with all the related federal laws and also the local laws. You must also make sure that the Sherman Oaks cruise ship attorney has a won several lawsuits on behalf of victims of similar cases. Good track record of the attorney will ensure that the victim gets properly recompensed. \r\n\r\n</p><p>This was a message of public importance from the Los Angeles personal injury lawyers at Ehline Law Firm. </p><p>6700 East Pacific Coast Highway<br />Suite 275, Long Beach, CA 90803<br />(562) 342-9092</p><p /><!--more-->This was a message of public importance from the Los Angeles personal injury lawyers at Ehline Law Firm. 6700 East Pacific Coast Highway\r\nSuite 275, Long Beach, CA 90803\r\n(562) 342-9092'

aS'<p>-Blog posted but not reviewed or edited by LedgerLaw-</p><p>If you are in the need of a personal injury lawyer you could be having trouble deciding if it is actually worth hiring one. The expenses you are facing right now probably include hospital bills, lost time from work with no income, paying for repairing your car if you were involved in a car accident, medication and probably therapy. Adding the cost of a personal injury lawyer to all of that seems a bad idea.</p><p>The truth is that when you find a personal injury lawyer and talk to him about your situation he will probably tell you that he needs around 40% of the amount you want to claim. So if you were planning on asking for an amount to cover your expenses, you will feel like half of it will go to the lawyer. However, a personal injury lawyer can win a huge amount for you that will be two times as high as the one you initially thought of. This means that you will actually have more money at the end of the case than before. You should also know that most personal injury lawyers get paid only if their client actually gets some money from court. </p><p>There are also other reasons that a personal injury lawyer can be of help. First of all, he can save you from the frustration of handling everything alone. You are probably not a lawyer yourself, so being able to handle the situation and making the right decisions is difficult. If you are hurt, things become even more difficult. So having someone o take care of these things and talk to the insurance company and other lawyers is the best thing you can do. You should also know that you will not be asked to pay the lawyer upfront. Most personal injury lawyers get paid after the case is closed and only if their client wins the case. This means that he might actually pay himself for some things like medical records or other documents he needs to make his statement.</p><p>You should also know that almost every state has different laws that apply. You can make your claim according to the laws of the state the injury occurred. An experienced personal injury lawyer can help you very much in that since different laws mean different things each time. a personal injury lawyer is a professional that can help you in any such case.</p><p /><p /><p /><p>Law Offices of Ledger &amp; Associates<br />811 Wilshire Blvd<br />Suite 1000<br />Los Angeles, CA 90017<br />Office: 213-493-6588<br />Toll Free 800-300-0001<br />Website: <a href="http://www.lawfirmdirectory.org">www.lawfirmdirectory.org</a></p><p /><!--more-->If you are in the need of a personal injury lawyer you could be having trouble deciding if it is actually worth hiring one.

aS'In a word, no.  The workers&#8217; compensation insurance company is required by law, \r\nwhen it receives medical evidence that an injured worker can return to work in \r\nany capacity, to provide prompt written notice to an injured worker advising the \r\nfollowing: the nature of the injured worker&#8217;s physical condition or change in \r\ncondition; that the injured worker has an obligation to look for available \r\nemployment; that proof of available employment may jeopardize the injured \r\nworker&#8217;s right to receive ongoing benefits; and that the injured worker has the \r\nright to consult with an attorney.  This information is sent to an injured \r\nworker on a <a  rel="nofollow" title="BWC Form " href="http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/forms/10421" target="&#95;blank" data-mce-href="http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/forms/10421">Bureau \r\nof Workers Compensation Form</a>, called a &#8220;Notice of Ability to Return to Work&#8221; \r\n(FORM LIBC 757). \r\n<p> The Notice of Ability to Return to Work form is an advisory document.  It \r\nwill tell the injured worker that a doctor has released you to some form of \r\nmodified duty or that you are fully recovered from your work injury.  The source \r\nof the information is crucial when determining what to do in response to The \r\nNotice of Ability to Return to Work.  Often the opinion of full recovery or the \r\nrelease to return to work at modified duty will come from the insurance company \r\ndoctor who has performed an independent medical examination (IME) or treated the \r\ninjured worker at an occupational health facility. Importantly, you do not have \r\nto return to work simply because you are told that a doctor feels you can return \r\nto modified duty, full duty or because you have been determined to be fully \r\nrecovered, particularly when the source of that opinion is the insurance company \r\ndoctor.</p>\r\n<p> It is also important to remember that before a workers&#8217; compensation \r\ninsurance company can take some action adverse to the interest of the injured \r\nworker, the workers&#8217; compensation insurance company must issue the Notice of \r\nAbility to Return to Work.  For instance, before a light duty job can be \r\noffered, the Notice of Ability to Return to Work form must be issued.  Likewise, \r\nbefore a Petition to Terminate Compensation Benefits can be filed, a Notice of \r\nAbility to Return to Work form must be issued.  The workers&#8217; compensation \r\ninsurance company relies upon the doctors utilized for an IME or at occupational \r\nhealth facilities to issue favorable opinions about an injured worker&#8217;s ability \r\nto return to work so a Notice of Ability to Return to Work can be issued and the \r\nprocess of reducing, stopping or terminating the injured worker&#8217;s benefits can \r\nbegin.</p>\r\n<p> If you receive a Notice of Ability to Return to Work, understand that the \r\nworkers&#8217; compensation insurance company may be developing a strategy to take \r\nsome action against your interests.  It is also important to understand you have \r\nthe ability to receive other medical opinions from your own doctor concerning \r\nyour work capabilities and need for additional treatment, and the opinion of the \r\ninsurance company doctor is simply an opinion, nothing more. </p>\r\n<p> Contact the Philadelphia workers&#8217; compensation attorneys at Pearson \r\nKoutcher, LLP if you receive a Notice of Ability to Return to Work.

aS'There are many reasons business owners choose to form a legal entity &#8211; whether a limited liability company, corporation, S-corporation or otherwise.  The most important reason is that forming a legal entity reduces personal liability.  Forming a legal entity also adds credibility and permits the business to grow.  Plus, a legal entity permits the business to build its own credit.  And ownership in the entity can be more easily transferred.<br />   <br /> <u>Limit Personal Liability</u>.  First, and foremost, forming a legal entity shields the owner(s) from personal liability for debts of the business and lawsuits against the company.  So the existence of a legal entity protects the your personal assets such as your home, car, possessions, and savings.  It does not, however, shield you against personal torts (injuries) that the owner commits on behalf of the entity.  This limited liability is often referred to as the &#8220;corporate veil&#8221; because the owners of the company are protected behind it.  It is very important, though, for business owners to understand that there are some limited situations where the corporate veil can be pierced to reach the personal assets of the business owners, such as where the owner co-mingles assets or does not abide by corporate formalities.<p><u>Grow Your Business, Now and Later</u>.  Second, forming a legal entity adds credibility to the business.  Forming a legal entity communicates not only credibility but also permanence and prestige.  The credibility that comes with forming a legal entity can also help your new business with potential customers, employees, vendors and partners.  At the same time, it informs those same people that they are dealing with an entity and not you personally.</p><p><u>Build Buiness Credit</u>.  Third, because a legal entity &#8211; whether corporation or an LLC &#8211; is a separate entity, you are able to establish both a new and separate credit profile completely distinct from your own personal credit profile.  Being able to establish business credit is especially advantageous for those who may have poor personal credit because it enables you to build a clear credit profile for the business.  As a result, you may be able to receive loans, credit cards and credit lines that you might not be able to obtain as an individual, and eventually at better interest rates.</p><p><u>Transfer of Ownership</u>.  Corporation ownership can be easily transferable (with some restrictions on S corporations).  Capital can be raised more  easily through the sale of stock.  Another advantage is that many banks prefer  handling loans with incorporated borrowers.  And while you can&#8217;t live forever&#8212;your corporation can.  Even if an owner dies or  sells interest, the corporation still exists.</p><p><a href="http://dahmanlaw.com/">Dahman Law, LLC</a> is a law firm in Columbus, Ohio which handles commercial litigation, business law, employment, and estate planning matters for business and individuals.  <a href="http://dahmanlaw.com/Dahman&#95;Law&#95;Disclaimer.pdf">Disclaimer</a>.</p><!--more-->Why you might want to incorporate your small business:&#160; limit personal liability, grow your business, build business creidt, and make ownership transferable.&#160;'

We intend to vigorously defend against the allegations,&#8221; Norton responded.</p><p>Another Kansas City-based lead counsel for the plaintiffs, George Hanson, said the plaintiffs believed they had evidence that Bank of America had a pattern and practice of paying what &#8220;equates to a salary to employees who technically are nonexempt and should be paid for their hours worked.&#8221;</p><p>The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge John Lungstrum, a veteran in handling complicated national labor law cases. </p><p>Unlike some current wage and hour cases, the lawsuits do not allege that the bank misclassified workers according to the Fair Labor Standards Act.

aS'<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/GivnerandKaye#p/u/9/&#95;4Ez8lwb2mc">The 3<sup>rd</sup> biggest mistake in asset\r\nprotection planning</a> is remaining in control after you transfer a valuable asset\r\nby not paying fair market value.&#160;If the parents remain in control, then they will likely be viewed as\r\ncontinuing to own the asset for creditor purposes and they will lose the asset\r\nto a judgment creditor.&#160;For example, part of mom and dad&#8217;s asset protection\r\nplan involves transferring their home to an irrevocable trust for the benefit\r\nof their children.&#160;But they fail\r\nto pay rent to the children&#8217;s trust.&#160;It might be OK for them not to pay rent while the children are minors\r\nliving at home with the parents.&#160;However, once the children are adults, mom and dad must pay rent for the\r\nright to live in the home.&#160;Otherwise, the parents really didn&#8217;t make a gift, and the asset\r\nprotection plan will fail.&#160;What if mom and dad sell the home to a children&#8217;s trust?\r\nIn asset protection planning we often see this mistake: the rent mom and dad\r\npay to the children&#8217;s trust just about equals the amount that the children&#8217;s\r\ntrust owes back to them on the purchase of the home.&#160;That is a big no-no.&#160;The amount of the rent must be determined by an independent appraisal,\r\njust like the sale price of the home must be determined by an independent\r\nappraisal.&#160;There are many other examples, of course.&#160; But the lesson to be learned here is\r\nthat any transfers made in asset protection planning must be made for full fair\r\nmarket value or the parents will still be treated as the owners and will lose\r\nthe assets to a creditor.

Without the help of an attorney, you face the maximum penalties for the crime of which you stand accused of committing. An experienced lawyer can fight to reduce or eliminate the charges against you, protect your rights, build a defense for your case, and negotiate with the prosecution.

This may be attributable to the many accidents, injuries and deaths caused by alcohol. In New York, if convicted of a DWI, you face costly fines, jail time, and a revocation of your license. Furthermore, each subsequent DWI offense receives increasingly harsher punishments. However, attorneys who practice DWI law may be able to reduce the charges against you. </li><li>Violent crimes: Accusation of a violent crime is an upsetting experience. Not only do you face expensive fines and a lengthy prison sentence, but you may also have trouble seeking future employment. If accused of a violent crime, it is imperative that you retain experienced counsel immediately. </li><li>Drug offenses: The law punishes these types of crimes harshly, and society looks down upon them. The least severe type of drug crime&#160; you can commit is possession of a small amount of a controlled substance. However, depending on the type of substance, and whether it is your first offense, you may still face serious penalties.

aS'-Blog posted but not reviewed or edited by LedgerLaw- <div></div><div><p class="MsoNormal">It is never pleasant to be involved in an accident. This is especially so if you injure yourself in the process, so much so that your health and your work is affected. If you are the sole breadwinner in your family, this can be very painful and affect all aspects of your life. However, do not fret because there is something you can do as a result of the accident. For instance, if you have slipped and fell in your office building or while at work, and sustained injuries as a result of the fall, then you are definitely eligible to claim for personal injury against your employers. As such, you would need to retain the services of a personal injury lawyer.</p><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>&#160;</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal">First of all, details are very important in making a personal injury lawsuit. Your personal injury lawyer would need certain information such as the date and time that the accident happened. This is especially so if it occurred as a result of your employer&#8217;s negligence. It would also be helpful if there were witnesses during the time of your fall. These witnesses could possibly be required to be called upon should the lawsuit be brought to court. Do not worry overmuch about this step at the early stages of your personal injury lawsuit because your lawyers would just need to file away this information for later use.</p><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>&#160;</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal">Next, your injury would of course need to be assessed by a doctor. Even before applying for a lawsuit, you need to get this done first because chances are you would want to claim for insurance as well. This step is equally important because it will let your lawyer know just how much you have lost due to the slip in terms of injuries, length of time it takes for you to recover, and extent of the injuries. If , for some odd reason, you are worried about the repercussions of filing a personal injury lawsuit against your employer, do remember that it isn&#8217;t personal. You are just protecting your interest and the best way to do it would be through your personal injury lawyer.</p><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>&#160;</p><p /><p class="MsoNormal">At the end of the day, if all safety procedures had been put in place, you would not have slipped and fallen, nor would you have been injured. A personal injury claim is the best way for you to gain back some compensation for the hurt and trouble that has been caused as a result of your fall.</p><p class="MsoNormal" /><p>&#160;</p><p /><p /><p>Ledger&#160;Law Firm<br />811 Wilshire Blvd<br />Suite 1000<br />Los Angeles, CA 90017<br />Office: 213-493-6588<br />Toll Free 800-300-0001<br />Website: <a href="http://www.ledgerlaw.com/">LedgerLaw</a></p><p /></div>'

aS'<p>The Los Angles County Fire Department is seeking to partner with the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department to provide low risk inmates for the Inmate Fire Camp Program. &#160;A local &#160;<a href="http://www.losangelescriminalattorneys.net" title="Los Angeles Criminal Defense Lawyer">Los Angeles Criminal Defense Lawyer</a>&#160;&#160;believes this is a very important program that benefits both the inmates and the community. &#160;Its a win win situation. &#160;Since 1981, the LA County Fire Department has worked with the California Department of Corrections to allow state inmates for the inmate fire camp program. The program consists of 24 inmate hand crews operating from five fire camps in the County of LA: Santa Clarita, San Gabriel Valley, Malibu, San Fernando, and Acton. With AB 109 which involves the state handing off low risk prisoners to the custody of local counties, the California Department of Corrections may not have the financial resources to continue the Fire Camp for low risk inmates. &#160;The LA County Fire Department has 485 beds for the Inmate Fire Camp Program. &#160;Fire crews provide a valuable resource in fighting multiple large wildland fires as was the case in Orange County during the Santiago Fire in 2007 and in San Diego County during the Cedar Fire in 2003. &#160;The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors should approve funding for this very important program. &#160;</p><p>Source: LA County Fire Department</p>'

In Virginia, the term <a target="&#95;self" href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+55-79.41">&#8220;Condominium Instruments&#8221;</a>\r\n is defined in the Virginia Condominium Act and includes the (i) \r\nDeclaration, (ii) Bylaws, and (iii) Plats and Plans that are recorded to\r\n establish a condominium. Any exhibit, schedule, or certification that \r\naccompanies any of those documents is considered an integral part of the\r\n Condominium Instruments. In addition, any amendment to or certification\r\n of the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans is part of the \r\nCondominium Instruments, provided that it was made in accordance with \r\nthe <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+TOC55000000004000020000000">Virginia Condominium Act</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The Declaration for a condominium is the document that creates the \r\ncondominium.&#160; The Declaration identifies the submitted land and any \r\nadditional land that may be added to the condominium community.&#160; It \r\naddresses the rights of the declarant in developing the community; \r\nidentifies the boundaries of each unit; identifies the common elements; \r\naddresses each unit owner&#8217;s interest in the common elements; and \r\nspecifies the improvements and the number of units that will be \r\nconstructed that will be completed by the declarant.</p>\r\n<p>The Bylaws for a condominium are also a recorded document.&#160; The \r\nBylaws provide for the self-government of the unit owners association.&#160; \r\nThe Bylaws address the election of directors, director and unit owner \r\nmeetings, maintenance responsibilities, assessments and insurance \r\nrequirements.</p>\r\n<p>You will note that we have not addressed Articles of Incorporation \r\nyet.&#160; Unit owners associations are not required to be incorporated.

The Norwalk facility has a bed capacity of 40. &#160;</p><p>The purpose of the reception centers is to identify population safety issues and mental health screenings. &#160;A Suicide Risk Assessment Questionnaire are completed within one hour. &#160; &#160;An Academic Evaluation is also done. &#160;This consists of a Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System, English Language Arts, math Diagnostic, Holland Vocational Inventory and California English Language Development test. &#160;Academic Records are also reviewed to identify achievement level and children in need of special education services. &#160;Psychological testing is also administered. &#160;The assessment instruments are the Weinberger Adjustment Inventory, Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument Youth Self Report, Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test 2, Voice Diagnoistic Interview Schedule for children and the Drug Experience Questionnaire. &#160;If a child scores below 70 in the Kaufman Brief Intelligence, then the Weschler\'s Intelligence Scale for children or the Weschler\'s Adult Intelligence Scale is administered. &#160;</p><p>Southern California has gone thru two prior closures and this will make it the third. If the Southern Youth Reception Center &amp; Clinic is closed the impact would cause children to be transferred to Ventura Youth Correctional Facility or to the N. A.

Clark High School at SYCRCC is the #1 ranked high school in DJJ. &#160;Employees also note the economic impact it will have on families of children housed at SYCRCC. &#160;It would be difficult for parents to visit their children as often as they would like. &#160;DJJ employees at SYCRCC are asking the Governor to reconsider and close the Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility in Stockton instead. &#160;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>'

aS'<p>The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has decided that the general permission of resale of software also applies, if the licenses have been downloaded from the Internet.</p><p /><p>GRP Rainer Lawyers Tax Advisors, Cologne, Berlin, Bonn, Duesseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Stuttgart, Hanover, Bremen, Nuremberg, Essen and London www.grprainer.com/en explain: By its judgment delivered the third of July 2012 (C-128/11) the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has decided that resale of licences for second hand software is in general possible, even if the licences in question have been downloaded from the internet. The Federal Court of Justice, Germany, had made a reference to the Court of Justice in order to interpret the directive on the legal protection of computer programs.</p><p>Under that directive a copyright holder who has marketed a copy in the territory of a Member State of the EU loses the right to rely on his monopoly of exploitation in order to oppose the resale of that copy. In its judgment the ECJ explains that the principle of exhaustion of the distribution right applies not only where the copyright holder markets copies of his software on a material medium but also where he distributes them by means of downloads from his website.</p><p>In both cases the copy right holder sells the copy to the costumer, which involves a transfer of the right of ownership of the copy. In the opinion of the ECJ a restriction of the resale of copies downloaded from the internet is not necessary to safeguard the intellectual property concerned. However, the judgment of the ECJ is not a complete success for the sellers of used software: Dividing licenses and selling only parts of them is not authorized.</p><p>Whoever is quicker with his ideas than others, has always the preference right. However, these ideas are often adopted by others and imitated. Due to spreading &quot;piracy&quot; and the infringement of copyright the protection of intellectual property is becoming more important today than ever before.</p><p>If there have been violations of someone&#8217;s brand or someone has been reprimanded for a violation, this person should contact a copyright lawyer.

aS'<p>Whenever involved in a car accident in San Bernardino getting an experienced car accident lawyer is the best way to go. There are a lot of damages that might happen as a result of the accident and having an experienced San Bernardino car accident lawyer can go over what a person is entitled to get back after the accident. \r\n\r\nMany people are surprised by all of the bills that can come after the accident. </p><p>There\'s not only the car accident to think about but sometimes medical bills. That\'s why when involved in a car accident in San Bernardino it\'s important to always keep the receipts of everything that happens, including the damage that happens to the car. \r\n\r\nIf the car gets totaled as a result of the accident, some people take the adjuster\'s word and estimate of how much the car might be worth. </p><p>Never automatically do that. Research newspapers, auto magazines, classified ads online and keep in mind what the year of the car is plus the model, make, mileage and what kind of condition it was in and what equipment the car had. All of this information will help with being able to decide the value of the car. \r\n\r\nAlways pay expenses out of the pocket with either credit cards or checks. When cash is used, always keep the receipt. </p><p>Getting a folder and putting a label on the folder plus receipts might help to make the process go faster. Ask the <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/pages/100045/san-bernardino-car-accident-attorneys.htm" title="san bernardino car accident attorney">San Bernardino car accident lawyer</a> questions. Make sure to let the lawyer know how much money was put in the car. Never be afraid to tell the lawyer how much money was spent on the car. Holding back information might hurt the case and the victims of the car accident might not get as much back because they didn\'t tell the lawyer everything.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBefore it&#8217;s time to talk with the lawyer, go through all of the receipts. Make sure that everything is there. Highlight important ones and write down dates when needed to help the case. The more information that the lawyer has about how much the car is worth and what was spent after the accident happened, the better. \r\nKeep medical bills in a separate folder and make sure that the lawyer has all of the information in regards to the medical bills. It&#8217;s best to double check everything twice instead of leaving something important out.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Michael Ehline, Esq., is a highly experienced personal injury attorney who is here to assist injured victims in car crash and transportation injury accident cases.&#160; Contact us at: </p><p>6700 East Pacific Coast Highway<br />#275, Long Beach, CA 90803<br />(562) 342-9092</p><!--more-->The more information that the lawyer has about how much the car is worth\r\n and what was spent after the accident happened, the better.

Many families have older family members that become residents of nursing homes and it is important to know the signs of elder abuse in order to stop it. The nursing home is entrusted to care for the aging adult that can no longer live on their own and might need more care than the family is able to provide. \r\n</p><p>There is physical, mental and financial elder abuse that the nursing home resident can suffer and when it becomes apparent there is a problem the family needs to take action, because these situations can become life threatening to the older adult. This is a person that is in a fragile state of health and any type of abuse should never happen, but when it does the elder abuse attorney might be just the person that is needed to stop the actions taking place. \r\n</p><p>The nursing home patient can be an <a href="http://www.nursingethicsnetwork.org/elder-abuse-are-dirty-words-and-actions-there-is-no-excuse-for-in-redondo-beach.html">elder abuse victim in Redondo Beach</a>, just as easily as being a SD victim, and are unable to defend themselves and often feel too embarrassed when abuse is occurring, which means they might not tell their family members. This leaves it up to the family to play detective every time they visit the nursing home and this means looking for a change in the person&#8217;s demeanor, bruising, check their appearance for cleanliness, because neglect is also <a href="http://www.nursingethicsnetwork.org/">elder abuse</a>. Frequent accidents like falls, broken bones, and other injuries should also be checked out completely. </p><p>The family should show up at different times and on different days to visit the aging adult, this way it can be possible to see what occurs when the nursing home staff is not expecting anyone to visit the victim that is suffering from elder abuse. The family needs to ask questions, every time they visit, which will let the nursing home staff know that they are watching to make sure that their parent, aunt, uncle or other relative is properly being cared for. \r\nElder abuse&#8212;the growing problem nationwide and in San Francisco occurs more often than most people realize and the statistics are frightening. </p><p>The elder abuse attorney will get to the bottom of the problem and they will hold the nursing home and staff accountable when there is elder abuse or neglect occurring.

Many times when parents split up and the children reside with one parent, and the parents have not yet begun legal proceedings, the parents decide between themselves the amount of child support. However, that is not permissible under Florida law because the legislature has established strict guidelines as to the amount of child support to be paid and how to calculate that amount. </p><p class="MsoNormal" MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" /><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Child support guidelines and calculation is governed by &#167;61.30, Florida Statutes. The calculation is based on the amount of money that both parents earn in a month and the number of children that the parents have had together. The statute provides a listing of the combined monthly income of parents from $650 to $10,000 and associates that number to an amount which theoretically both parents contribute to the children each month. This number is called the &#8220;basic obligation&#8221; and depends on the number of children you have with the other parent. For instance, if the two parents earn $650 per month combined, then the basic obligation or the amount both parents contribute to the support of one child is $74 per month. For two children it would be $75, for six children it would be $78. If the parents earn a combined monthly total of $6,000, then both parents theoretically contribute the amount of $1121 per month for one child, $1737 for two children, and $2175 for three children and so on up to $2860 for six children. Income according to the statute includes wages and salary; bonuses, commissions overtime and tips; business income if self employed meaning total revenues minus business expenses; disability benefits; workers compensation and unemployment benefits; pension/retirement and social security benefits; alimony received; rental income; gains from dealing in real property unless the gain is not recurring. When calculating the combined monthly income of the parents, do not use the gross income. Only use the net income, which is the gross income less taxes, mandatory union dues, mandatory retirement payments but they must be mandatory meaning you have no choice but to contribute, health insurance payments for the parents not the children, and court ordered support for other children and court ordered alimony or spousal support. </p><p class="MsoNormal" MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" /><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Once you have obtained the basic obligation based on the net monthly income of the parents and the number of children involved, add to that figure the monthly cost of health insurance for the children. If any of the children attend child care, then take 75% of the monthly cost of child care and add that as well. Use 75% because the parent with whom the child resides can get a 25% tax credit on taxes for the child care cost. This figure then becomes the new basic obligation which, theoretically according to the Florida legislature, is the amount that both parents combined contribute to the support of their children.&#160; The next calculation involves obtaining each parent&#8217;s percentage of the combined monthly income. Obtain that figure by taking each parent&#8217;s monthly net income and dividing it by the combined monthly income. For example, if the combined monthly net income between the parties is $6,000, and each parent earns $3000 net monthly income, then the calculation for each parent would be 3000/6000 which equals 50%, meaning each parent earns 50% of the combined net monthly income between the parties. If the combined net monthly income is $6000, one parent earns $2000 per month net, then that parent contributes $2000/$6000 or 1/3 or 33.3% of the combined net monthly income of the parents.&#160;Then to determine the amount of child support each party would separately contribute, take each parents percentage of the combined net monthly income and multiply it in decimal form by the basic obligation amount. For example, if the parties have one child together, their&#160; monthly net combined income is $6,000, the father makes $4000 net income per month and there is no child care or health insurance cost,&#160; the statute provides the basic obligation would be $1121. The father&#8217;s percentage of the monthly net income is $4000/$6000 which equals 2/3 which equals .667 (66.7%) of the combined net monthly income. Take the .667 and multiply by the basic obligation of $1121 which equals $747.71 per month that the father would have to pay the mother if the child resided with the mother as primary residential custodial parent. If the child resided with the father who was the residential custodial parent, then take the mother&#8217;s percentage of the combined net monthly income ($2000/$6000=1/3=.333) and multiply that by the basic obligation (.333 times $1121) equals $373.29 which the mother would pay the father if he were the primary residential custodial parent. The party who is not the residential custodial parent always pays the party who is the residential custodial parent. If you haven&#8217;t begun legal proceedings, then the parent with whom the child resides would be entitled to receive the child support. <b mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">This type of child support calculation is for situations where the primary residential parent has the child overnight at least 60% of the time. If the other parent (secondary parent) has visitation (timesharing) with the child for more than 40% of the overnights, then there is a different and more complicated calculation and the secondary parent would pay less. </b></p><p /><p class="MsoNormal" MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><b mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></b><b mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This article is for information purposes.

aS'<p>Clients often come to me asking for advice on whether they should try to terminate parental rights of their child\'s other parent.&#160; In some of these cases, the biological parent has been literally absent for years, not paying support and not seeking visitation. </p><p>Each state has specific laws regarding how parental rights may be terminated.&#160; This article pertains to the law in Texas. </p><p>Parental&#160;rights may be terminated voluntarily or involuntarily. When voluntary, the parent whose rights are being terminated will consent to the termination, and file the proper paperwork or appear in court.&#160; If involuntary, the person contests the termination of his or her rights,&#160;and the judge will make the final decision.&#160;</p><p>If you are a&#160;parent who is thinking about seeking termination of an absent parent\'s rights, here are some things you should know;&#160;</p><p>1. The courts will be protective of the rights of all the parties. You may know that he/she has been a terrible parent, but you will have to prove it.&#160; You should gather any evidence that you have. People are often shocked to discover that they have to go through several legal steps and have solid, specific proof to terminate a &quot;deadbeat&quot; parents rights. </p><p>2.&#160;The court may appoint an attorney to represent your child.&#160; Often called an &quot;attorney ad litem&quot;, this attorney will gather facts, interview involved parties and witnesses, appear at hearings, and make recommendations as to the &quot;best interest of the child&quot;.&#160;</p><p>3.&#160; Another attorney may be appointed to represent an absent or unknown parent.&#160; </p><p>4.&#160; You will have to reveal&#160;where the other party is; or reveal his/her last known location. You, your attorney, or another attorney connected to the case will have to contact, or make best efforts to find that person. If there has been a long period of time with no communication, you should consider what might happen when communication is resumed.&#160; (this is especially important if the other parent may be violent). </p><p>5. The court will require that a home study be performed by a qualified person, in order to gather information about the parties and their environment. </p><p>6. When budgeting for the case, you should consider the costs of the attorneys ad litem and home study. As the person filing the suit (&quot;petitioner&quot;) you will usually pay these fees.&#160; (some counties have &quot;Family Services&quot; departments which perform the home studies&#160;and the fees are&#160;on a &quot;sliding scale&quot; based on&#160;income). </p><p>There are times when the &quot;best interest of the&#160;child&quot; requires that&#160;the parental rights of a biological parent be terminated.&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the procedure is an emotional one, it can be an important step to building a healthy family and moving towards the future.&#160;</p><p>&#160;<br />If you believe that this may be right for your family, the first step is to consult with a knowledgable&#160;attorney&#160;who practices family law and is familiar with&#160;Texas&#160;law involving termination of parental rights (or the law of your state). </p><p>Laura Kalish is a partner in Kalish Law Office in&#160;the Houston area.&#160; She may be reached at 281-363-3700.&#160;Kalish&#160;Law&#160;Office has been representing clients in&#160;family law courts since&#160;1984.

aS'H-1B visa allows US employers to hire temporary foreign workers in specialty occupations like engineering, medicine, and health, architecture, education, law, business professionals, theology, and arts.<br /><br />That said, Microsoft, a US information technology, one of the software giant companies in America, has suggested an enormous $10,000 fee to employ expatriates for a new category H-1B visas and $15,000 for the new category permanent residency visa, or Green Card. The said company also has advocated more work visas since the recession in 2008.<br /><br />The proposal was revealed by Brad Smith, the general counsel and executive vice president, legal and corporate affairs of Microsoft during a brainstorming session in Washington based last month, suggesting that IT companies should pay $10,000 for each foreign worker they hire under the expanded Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics- commonly known as (STEM) H-1B visa and $15,000 for each Green Card issued from the US permanent residency program. The maximum intake under the new visas would be 20,000 a year.<br /><br />Microsoft currently has 6,000 job openings in the United States, of which more than 3,400 of those are for researchers, engineers, and developers.<br /><br />If this proposal gets accepted, it could hit Indian IT companies the hardest while leaving the US government richer by $5 billion for just a 10 year period. However, the money that would be raised could be used to raise funds for STEM education programmes within the United States. It could also help provide additional resources to recruit and train STEM teachers, broaden access to computer science in high schools, and expand higher education capacity to produce more STEM degrees, according to Smith.<br /><br />For more answers to frequently asked questions, to chat live with Timothy A.

This can be the negligent actions of a motor vehicle driver, a defective part or design, and it can be due to roadway maintenance negligence. <p /><p>The most common injuries are caused by the negligent driver.

aS'<p>In January, <em><strong>Pennsylvania</strong></em> implemented several changes to its <em><strong>Unemployment Compensation Law</strong> </em>(&#8220;the Law&#8221;). Of these changes, two stood out to us as being noteworthy. The first is the addition of an &#8220;Active Search&#8221; requirement and the second is a reduction of <em><strong>Unemployment Compensation benefits</strong></em> to offset severance payments.</p><strong>Unemployment Benefits Hinge on &#8220;Active Search&#8221;</strong><p>The first notable change is the <strong><em>&#8220;Active Search&#8221; requirement</em></strong>. The former law required that individuals seeking unemployment benefits be &#8220;able and available for suitable work,&#8221; but<strong> </strong>the new Act requires &#8220;<strong><em>an active search for suitable employment</em></strong>.&#8221; The burden now is on the individual to show efforts in making an actual search for available employment rather than just being available for suitable employment.</p><p>The responsibility to define the minimum requirements for an active search has been given to the Department of Labor and Industry. However, the statute does recognize that the requirements should be adaptable, taking into account how a job search is usually conducted in the individual&#8217;s line of work.</p><p>The <a title="Active Search Guidelines" href="http://www.dli.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/l&#95;i&#95;home/5278">Active Search guidelines </a>are available in full on the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry&#8217;s website.&#160; In order to be considered engaged in an active search for suitable work, an individual must</p><p>1) register with CareerLink;</p><p>2) post a resume on the unemployment compensation database; and</p><p>3) apply for jobs on the system&#8217;s database located within a 45 minute commute of one&#8217;s home.</p><p>An unemployed individual must also keep a record of their job searching activities. The <em><strong>Active Search</strong> </em>requirement does not apply to laid-off individuals who have been promised by their employer that they will be rehired within 28 days of being laid-off.</p><strong>Unemployment Benefits Now Reduced by Severance Pay</strong><p>Severance pay is defined by law as &#8220;one or more payments made by an employer to an employee on account of separation from the service of the employer, regardless of whether the employer is legally bound by contract, statute or otherwise to make such payments.&#8221; As revised, the Law provides that an individual&#8217;s weekly <strong><em>unemployment benefits</em> </strong>are to be reduced by &#8220;the amount of severance pay that is attributed to the week.&#8221;</p><p>In accordance with the changes, an individual&#8217;s unemployment compensation benefits will be offset by the amount of severance benefits in excess of 40% of the &#8220;average annual wage&#8221;, which is $17,843 for 2012.&#160; <strong>This means that an individual can receive $17,843 in severance pay before unemployment compensation payments are affected. </strong>Any additional amount of severance over $17,843 is then used to reduce the individual&#8217;s unemployment benefits.</p><p><strong>The severance offset does not, however, include payments for retirement, pension, accrued leave, or supplemental unemployment compensation benefits.</strong>&#160; Moreover, the new amendment expressly states that any severances paid by an agreement reached before January 1, 2012 are not subject to the changes effective January 1, 2012.</p><strong>Call the Pennsylvania Workers&#8217; Compensation Attorneys at Galfand Berger for More Information</strong><p>The loss of a job can be a very stressful time.

aS'CUSTODY CONUNDRUM<br /><br />No-one likes to think about divorce and child custody issues.&#160; If not personally experienced, then most of us are aware of these issues through friends, acquaintances or family members.&#160; We don&#8217;t want to talk or even think about losing any contact with our kids, but many are faced with tough decisions regarding their families in the context of divorce.&#160; New laws enacted in <a href="http://www.fox-shjeflo.com/" Title="California Attorney">California</a> just made these rough decisions even harder.<br /><br />Effective January 1, 2012, portions of the Family Code which govern child custody proceedings were revised. Many family law practitioners believe the new law is troubling in that it places children smack dab in the middle of custody disputes.&#160;&#160; <br /><br />The new law states that children fourteen years and older who want to address the court may testify regarding custody or visitation issues, unless the court feels it is not in the best interest of the child.&#160; If the judge finds it is not in the best interest of the child to testify, the judge will have to explain her reason for precluding the testimony on the record.&#160; Those younger than fourteen can also address the court if the judge feels it is in the best interest of the child.&#160; If a child is not allowed to testify, the judge must find an alternate means of getting a child&#8217;s input on these issues.&#160; <br /><br />Though nothing requires a child to testify, if an attorney for a parent requests that a child fourteen or older testify, the Court will have to allow it unless there is a good reason not to.&#160; <br /><br />All this means that parents may force their children to testify, or, worse yet, coach a child to testify a certain way.&#160; Though some children may want to testify, others may want to just stay out of their parents&#8217; fight.&#160; The new law makes it harder to keep kids out of it. Time will tell how it all will play out, but families in the midst of divorce and custody disputes have some tough decisions to make.<!--more-->Making decisions in custody and visitation disputes in California just got harder.'

aS'<p>-Blog posted but not reviewed or edited by LedgerLaw-</p><p>A lot of factors contribute to and inevitably determine the outcome of any court case. However, one of the most important factors that can make or mar any case is the choice of attorney. For injury cases, the choice of personal injury attorney goes a long way in determining whether you will be compensated adequately for injuries sustained. As such, the selection of a personal injury attorney should only be done after conducting a careful search. This shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult; what is required is the ability to look out for certain traits and qualities. These include the following.</p><p><b>Experience</b></p><p>When talking about a personal injury attorney&#8217;s experience, certain things must be understood. Experience doesn&#8217;t just refer to the number of years a personal injury attorney has spent on litigation. The key word is actually relevant experience. For instance, if you have been involved in a case of motorcycle accident, then the personal injury attorney you need to consider is one who specializes in motorcycle accident cases. The same thing applies to other personal injury cases: always seek out a personal injury attorney experienced in handling the specific case you have been involved in.</p><p><b>Past Verdicts</b></p><p>In the world of injury litigation, one of the yardsticks for measuring the quality of a personal injury attorney is the verdict obtained. The quality of verdicts obtained for previous clients serves as a pointer for determining and assessing whether the attorney has the potential of obtaining favorable verdicts in your own case. Thus, you should ask for previous verdicts obtained and confirm the veracity. This shouldn&#8217;t be difficult however because a successful personal injury attorney will not hesitate to inform you about his or her previous conquests.</p><p><b>Terms of Service</b></p><p>Selection of a personal injury attorney also entails understanding the attorney&#8217;s terms of service. Before making a final decision, you need to be clear about the agreement between you and the personal injury attorney particularly as this relates to his or her fee. Most personal injury attorneys work under a CFA i.e. a conditional fee agreement. This is also sometimes referred to as contingency basis and it simply means that the attorney will only get paid a certain percentage of the total settlement if the case is won. The percentage varies greatly from attorney to attorney and you should ensure that you get a fair deal before hiring any attorney. </p><p /><p>Law Offices of Ledger &amp; Associates<br />811 Wilshire Blvd<br />Suite 1000<br />Los Angeles, CA 90017<br />Office: 213-493-6588<br />Toll Free 800-300-0001<br />Website: <a href="http://www.injurylawyergroup.com">www.injurylawyergroup.com</a></p><p /><!--more-->A lot of factors contribute to and inevitably determine the outcome of any court case.

This gives them the opportunity to have you examined by a doctor of their choice.</p><p>The doctor who performs the examination will not provide you with any medical treatment and no doctor-patient relationship will be established. The doctor will simply prepare a report with his opinion about your medical condition and whether you can work.&#160; This report should be provided to you or your attorney within 15 days after it is completed.</p><p>The truth is that these examinations are never really independent.&#160; Insurance companies use the same doctors over and over again because they know what to expect.&#160; Many of these doctors make a career out of testifying for insurance companies and earn hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.</p><p>It is common for a doctor performing an independent medical examination to determine that your condition is not work-related or that you can go back to work without any restrictions.

An example would be a positive MRI report.</p><p>Do not sign any medical releases or other documents without consulting a lawyer. You can politely decline and ask to take it home&#160;to review.

aS'<p>I am somewhat mystified when I see a seminar topic for lawyers on how to prepare a case for arbitration and/or mediation. The fact is the case should be presented in an arbitration hearing or in a mediation setting just as a case is prepared for trial: you put your best foot forward. There is no special preparation for arbitration or mediation. <a title="American Arbitration Association" href="http://www.adr.org/" target="&#95;blank">Arbitration</a> is a hearing out of which comes a final and binding decision with all rights of appeal waived. The individual who serves as arbitrator is often a retired judge but it can just as easily be an attorney and, in fact, it need not be an attorney. The arbitrator is selected by the parties and he/she attests to his/her neutrality. A mediation is an attempt by a neutral to bring the parties together toward resolution. Both sides make a presentation and the mediator spends the rest of the day caucusing with each side and occasionally brings all parties together for an update or assessment. The purpose of mediation is that at the end of the process, usually taking a day but often more than that, the case has been resolved.</p><p>There may be certain strategic considerations in approaching a trial, arbitration or mediation differently. The basic thrust is the same, however. The case must be well-prepared to obtain the best result regardless of the forum.

It is a common misconception that a couple must live together for a specific period of time before they are considered common law married, but under Iowa law, that is not how it is determined.</p><div color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; "><p margin: 0px; "></p></div><div color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; "><p margin: 0px; ">The most comprehensive discussion of Iowa common law marriage recently has been the case&#160;<u>In re Marriage of Martin</u>, 681 N.W.2d 612 (Iowa 2004), and therefore that is the case I am using to outline Iowa law on this topic.</p></div><div color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; "><p margin: 0px; "></p></div><div color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; "><p margin: 0px; ">At the outset, it is important to understand that Iowa law does not favor common law marriage. That means that the party asserting there was a common law marriage bears the burden, and such claims are &quot;carefully scrutinized.&quot; So it is no easy feat to have a common law marriage declared. To establish a common law marriage, one must prove three elements: present intent and agreement to be married by both parties, continuous cohabitation, and a public declaration that the parties are married.&#160;</p></div><div color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; "><p margin: 0px; "></p></div><div color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; "><p margin: 0px; "><u>Present Intent to be Married:</u>&#160;This element reflects the contractual nature of marriage, requiring agreement by both parties, like any other contract. This agreement does not have to be express, meaning the parties do not have to discuss and decide to be married. Instead, it is usually sufficient for one party to intend to be married, and the other to act in such a way to indicate he or she agreed. Evidence of present intent to be married consists largely of the conduct of the parties and their reputation in the community as a married couple (if neighbors, teachers, etc. thought the couple was married). Please note that this is present intent to be married, not future intent. That is, if the couple was engaged to be married some time in the future, there is no common law marriage.</p></div><div color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; "><p margin: 0px; "></p></div><div color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; "><p margin: 0px; "><u>Continuous Cohabitation:</u>&#160;Living together alone does not establish common law marriage, but is considered basic to establishing that a couple is married. There is no specific time that a couple must live together. It is an extension of proving the present intent to be married, so this factor will balance against other factors in each given case.</p></div><div color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; "><p margin: 0px; "></p></div><div color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; "><p margin: 0px; "><u>Public Declaration:</u>&#160;The Iowa Supreme Court considers this to be the acid test for common law marriage. A couple must hold itself out as married to be common law married. Some inconsistent statements are allowed. In general, the Court will look for a substantial holding out to the public as married.</p></div><div color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; "><p margin: 0px; "></p></div><div color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; "><p margin: 0px; ">All of these elements are very fact-specific. That is, whether a specific couple is common law married is going to depend very much on the facts surrounding that specific couple. An attorney can help analyze the issues, but the final determination will have to be made by a judge.</p></div><div color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; "><p margin: 0px; "></p></div><div color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; "><p margin: 0px; ">Why would someone want to be established as common law married? It usually arises in one of two factual scenarios. First, one of the parties has died, and the other would like to recover under his or her estate as the spouse. Second, one party leaves the other party, and a party would like to have the property divided through a divorce rather than based on pure ownership. That is the most important thing to remember about common law marriage: once you are in one, it takes a divorce to get out of the marriage. Be careful what you ask for.&#160;</p></div>'
